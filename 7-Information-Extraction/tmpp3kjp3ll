The remains believed to be those of 11 United States servicemen missing in action in the Korean War and Indochina have been returned to the United States .
The remains arrived in Hawaii on Friday and were taken to an Army laboratory at Hickam Air Force Base here for identification , according to the United States military 's Joint Task Force-Full Accounting , which conducts search missions for the remains of missing servicemen .
The Hilton Hanoi Opera hotel has opened , a few blocks from Hoa Lo , the infamous `` Hanoi Hilton '' where American prisoners were held during the Vietnam War .
Americans missing in action from the Vietnam War will be honored by an inscription on an empty crypt at the Tomb of the Unknowns in Arlington National Cemetery , the Pentagon said today .
The inscription will read , `` Honoring and keeping faith with America 's missing servicemen , '' Under Secretary of Defense Rudy De Leon said in announcing that no new remains from Vietnam would be interred at the tomb for now , or perhaps ever .
