The United States and North Korea announced today that later this year they expect to begin their first joint effort to search for the remains of thousands of Americans soldiers missing from the Korean War .
The announcement , which could signal a broad improvement in ties between the two countries , means that Pentagon investigators could soon be wandering the North Korean countryside , searching for evidence of the burial sites of Americans missing since the war ended in 1953 .
Under the agreement , reached after six days of negotiations in New York City , the United States will pay $ 2 million to North Korea for its earlier efforts to locate the remains of the more than 8,100 Americans and United Nations personnel , most of them Americans , reported missing in the Korea War .
In a joint statement , the United States commended North Korea for `` its past sincere efforts in recovering and returning U.S. servicemen 's remains , '' and both countries expressed `` their belief that this agreement will contribute to the improvement of relations . ''
President Clinton announced today that he was nominating a former American prisoner of war in Vietnam , Representative Pete Peterson of Florida , as the first Ambassador to the reunified Socialist Republic of Vietnam .
The Defense Department insisted today that it had `` no conclusive proof that Americans are being held against their will '' in North Korea , even though an internal Pentagon report has suggested that as many as 10 to 15 American prisoners of war are still alive there .
The internal report , which was made public last week by a member of Congress , has set off a firestorm among the families of soldiers missing in action from the Korean War and the Vietnam War .
American veterans of the Vietnam War took another step toward reconciliation with their former enemies today , handing over information about mass graves where 600 North Vietnamese servicemen are thought to be buried .
