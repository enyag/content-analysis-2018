TITLE: Preventing the Exploitation of Information and Communications Technologies for Terrorist Purposes While Respecting Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms

TEXT: I would like to begin by thanking the UN Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) and the Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate (CTED) for organizing this special meeting today, and the technical sessions yesterday and this morning. I was pleased to participate in last December’s CTC meeting on this issue as well. The United States Government, like many other governments, understands the challenging nature of this issue. Terrorist groups, especially the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) also known as “Da’esh”, have become increasingly adept at using the Internet and information and communications technologies (ICT), along with other tools, to raise money, propagate their messages, recruit individuals, and inspire violent acts. As technology has adapted, so too have those who seek to abuse it. We know that terrorist organizations like Da’esh use social media to recruit terrorist fighters worldwide to join the fight in Syria and Iraq or homegrown violent extremists to launch attacks where they live. We know that they have expressed an interest in developing greater offensive cyber capabilities. And we know that some terrorists use technology and sophisticated techniques to hide their online activities. However, we should understand that the Internet is only one tool among many others. It is not the problem. As powerful as the internet is, we must avoid treating it as the problem. The Internet is a tool; the terrorists and criminals who abuse it are the problem. We also must not let our efforts to address this threat put at risk the open, interoperable, secure, and reliable global Internet we seek to preserve and expand. Our economic, political, and social welfare cannot thrive if we fail to protect the aspects of the Internet that provide such benefit to daily life. The challenge is how to aggressively investigate, disrupt, and deter criminal activity online, including terrorism, while preserving the characteristics of the Internet that make it so vital to modern society. We must, by all lawful means, counter terrorist and other criminal uses of the Internet, including social media, and the use of information technology, while respecting international obligations and commitments regarding human rights, including freedom of expression, as well as the free flow of information, and a free and open Internet. Even in the case of the most vitriolic websites and social media accounts in the United States, much of their content is protected by our Constitution and international obligations. Whether an individual’s conduct in using the Internet is of the sort that violates U.S. law (e.g., solicitation to commit certain crimes, issuing threats of violence, or engaging in material support for terrorism) is decided on a case-by-case basis consistent with the U.S. Constitution and human rights obligations. Therefore, U.S. efforts to counter the use of the Internet for terrorist purposes focus on criminal activities that involve facilitating or engaging in terrorism, such as illicit financing, attack planning and coordination, recruiting, criminal solicitation, and providing material support to terrorist groups. To accomplish our goal of investigating, disrupting and prosecuting terrorists’ illegal activities, we rely on both regional and international cooperation. States should work cooperatively to ensure that they protect their networks, share best practices, and communicate regarding threats, investigations and prosecutions. It is also important for governments to work closely and creatively with civil society, academia, and the private sector; governments certainly cannot – and should not – do this alone. Private companies have a crucial role to play in setting their own boundaries and defining the terms under which they will allow customers to use their services. For instance, companies can take voluntary action to remove violent extremist content that violates their terms of service. Companies may, for business reasons, prohibit posting content on their services that governments cannot regulate consistent with their own laws and international obligations. And companies are more proactively playing a role, including by revising their terms of service to clearly prohibit the use of their services to promote terrorism and violence and taking action to suspend accounts that violate company policies. For example, Twitter reported in August that it has suspended over 360,000 accounts for violating Twitter’s policies related to promotion of terrorism since the middle of 2015—primarily related to support for Da’esh. While companies can continue to do more, as noted by numerous third parties, Twitter’s efforts continue to drive meaningful results, including a significant shift in this type of activity off of Twitter. Governments can play a role in working with the private sector and civil society on a voluntary basis to discourage the use of the Internet to promote violent extremism and to encourage positive counter narratives. In many cases, promoting alternative viewpoints is a more effective response to objectionable speech than suppression of that speech. For example, we can most effectively counter violent extremists’ propaganda on the Internet by contesting terrorist narratives and worldviews through competing or alternative messages. Ensuring that effective counter and alternative messages are available and reach vulnerable audiences is a critical part of our response to violent extremism. Governments are not always the best messengers, but they can partner effectively and creatively with third parties such as civil society and the private sector. To be effective, counter narratives and countermessaging need to come from a range of credible voices, such as engaged citizens – including women and youth – as well as community leaders, civil and religious groups, former violent extremists and victims and survivors of violent extremism. Local communities can play an essential role in developing counter narratives. Well-informed and equipped families, communities, and local institutions represent the strongest defense against violent extremism. As we better educate and inform local communities to build trust and resilience against recruitment and radicalization to violence, they become enlisted in developing effective solutions that address local drivers of radicalization to violence – as well as the life cycle of radicalization. As we work to address the use of the Internet for terrorist purposes, we must be careful not to allow the threat to undermine our commitment to human rights – especially freedoms of expression and association, as well as privacy. Heavy handed efforts by governments to cut off free expression (however uncomfortable the speech) may further alienate those who may be most vulnerable to rhetoric that promotes violence. Even more problematic is the potential for such government efforts to chill online activity more broadly, undermining the social and economic benefits that the open Internet has demonstrated it can provide across the world. Although the Internet provides an important medium for Da’esh, al-Qa’ida and other terrorist groups to spread messages that attempt to justify violence and recruit followers, we need to recognize that the Internet is but one tool of many that terrorists use. Because recruitment and radicalization to violence continues to occur through person-to-person interaction, our efforts to counter radicalization to violence must continue to focus on engagement with those who may be targeted by violent extremists and the social and physical networks that influence them – whether online or offline. And local communities can play a key role in building resilience to violent extremist ideologies and the drivers of violent extremism. Government efforts to suppress speech can undermine efforts to counter violent extremism by providing another grievance that violent extremists can exploit. In closing, I offer the following four observations and recommendations for future action. 1. We must continue to adapt to and confront the challenges posed by the use of the Internet for terrorist purposes, relying heavily on the strength of our federal, state, local, and international partnerships. States should work cooperatively to ensure that they protect their networks, share best practices, and communicate regarding threats, investigations and prosecutions. 2. Governments certainly cannot – and should not – do this work alone. We must continue to work closely and creatively with communities, civil society, academia, and the private sector. Governments should continue to partner effectively and creatively with third parties to counter the threats from the use of the Internet for terrorist purposes. 3. We can most effectively counter violent extremists’ propaganda on the Internet by contesting terrorist narratives and worldviews through countermessages or alternative messages. And the best messengers to speak out against violent extremism are not necessarily governments, but rather credible voices including community leaders, civil society, women, and youth. 4. Finally, it is important that countering terrorism not be used to justify the suppression of legitimate political dissent and other expression that is politically inconvenient. This is counterproductive for our long-term goals to counter terrorism and violent extremism. Freedom of expression and the free flow of information are fundamental defenses against violence and conflict. I will just note that today we are here to discuss how nations, businesses, communities, and organizations, such as the UN, can better address the diverse challenges associated with terrorist use of the Internet. This is an excellent opportunity to share good practices and successful measures taken in this area, while keeping in mind that effective policies and practices must respect international human rights obligations and commitments, such as freedom of expression. The United Nations has an extremely valuable role to play in raising the profile of this global threat and helping identify effective measures that can be taken, especially in regard to implementation of UN Security Council Resolutions 1373, 1624, 2178, and the UN Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy. The United States appreciates the opportunity to engage on this timely and important issue. We appreciate the discussions we’ve had over the last two days in the technical sessions, and we look forward to hearing other participants’ remarks on effectively using both technology and policy to counter the use of the Internet for terrorist purposes in this meeting. Thank you for the opportunity to be a part of this important discussion.

TITLE: Remarks on International Law and Stability

TEXT: Thank you to Saira for that kind introduction, and thank you to the Miller Institute, the Human Rights Center, and the Berkeley Center for Law and Technology for inviting me to give this talk. I am honored to be back at Boalt Hall. I’ve had the chance to spend a few days in Berkeley meeting with students and feeling nostalgic. I also spent some time at the beginning of my trip at the Stanford campus, where I was an undergraduate. Please do not hold that against me as you listen to my remarks! From my short time back, it is clear that this city and this law school remain as vibrant and socially engaged today as they were when I was a student here nearly 20 years ago. This is a fitting place to discuss the topic I am here to speak about today—the importance of international law and stability in cyberspace—just across the Bay from Silicon Valley, home to many of the world’s largest and most innovative information technology companies. The remarkable reach of the Internet and the ever-growing number of connections between computers and other networked devices are delivering significant economic, social, and political benefits to individuals and societies around the world. In addition, an increasing number of States and non-State actors are developing the operational capability and capacity to pursue their objectives through cyberspace. Unfortunately, a number of those actors are employing their capabilities to conduct malicious cyber activities that cause effects in other States’ territories. Significant cyber incidents—including many that are reportedly State-sponsored—frequently make headline news. In light of this, it is reasonable to ask: could we someday reach a tipping point where the risks of connectivity outweigh the benefits we reap from cyberspace? And how can we prevent cyberspace from becoming a source of instability that could lead to inter-State conflict? I don’t think we will reach such a tipping point, but how we maintain cyber stability in order to preserve the continued benefits of connectivity remains a critical question. And international law, I would submit, is an essential element of the answer. Existing principles of international law form a cornerstone of the United States’ strategic framework of international cyber stability during peacetime and during armed conflict. The U.S. strategic framework is designed to achieve and maintain a stable cyberspace environment where all States and individuals are able to realize its benefits fully, where there are advantages to cooperating against common threats and avoiding conflict, and where there is little incentive for States to engage in disruptive behavior or to attack one another. There are three pillars to the U.S. strategic framework, each of which can help to ensure stability in cyberspace by reducing the risks of misperception and escalation. The first is global affirmation of the applicability of existing international law to State activity in cyberspace in both peacetime and during armed conflict. The second is the development of international consensus on certain additional voluntary, non-binding norms of responsible State behavior in cyberspace during peacetime, which is of course the predominant context in which States interact. And the third is the development and implementation of practical confidence-building measures to facilitate inter-State cooperation on cyber-related matters. I’ll address two of these pillars—international law and voluntary, non-binding norms—in greater detail today. International Law. In September 2012, my predecessor, Harold Koh, delivered remarks on “International Law in Cyberspace” at U.S. Cyber Command’s Legal Conference. It says a lot about where we were four years ago that the first two questions Koh addressed in his speech were as fundamental as: “Do established principles of international law apply to cyberspace?” and “Is cyberspace a law-free zone, where anything goes?” (So as not to leave you hanging, the answers to those questions are an emphatic “yes” and “no” respectively!) We have made significant progress since then. One prominent forum in which these issues are discussed is the United Nations (UN) Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) that deals with cyber issues in the context of international security. The GGE is a body established by the UN Secretary-General with a mandate from the UN General Assembly to study, among other things, how international law applies to States’ cyber activities, with a view to promoting common understandings. In 2013, the 15-State GGE recognized the applicability of existing international law to States’ cyber activities. Just last year, the subsequent UN GGE on the same topic, expanded to include 20 States, built on the 2013 report and took an additional step by recognizing the applicability in cyberspace of the inherent right of self-defense as recognized in Article 51 of the UN Charter. The 2015 GGE report also recognized the applicability of the law of armed conflict’s fundamental principles of humanity, necessity, proportionality, and distinction to the conduct of hostilities in and through cyberspace. With other recent bilateral and multilateral statements, including that of the leaders of the Group of Twenty (G20) States in 2015, we have seen an emerging consensus that existing international law applies to States’ cyber activities. Recognizing the applicability of existing international law as a general matter, however, is the easy part, at least for most like-minded nations. Identifying how that law applies to specific cyber activities is more challenging, and States rarely articulate their views on this subject publicly. The United States already has made some efforts in this area, including by setting forth views on the application of international law to cyber activities in Koh’s 2012 speech and also in the U.S. submission to the 2014–15 UN GGE, both of which are publicly available in the Digest of U.S. Practice in International Law. The U.S. Department of Defense also has presented its views on aspects of this topic in its publicly available Law of War Manual. But more work remains to be done. Increased transparency is important for a number of reasons. Customary international law, of course, develops from a general and consistent practice of States followed by them out of a sense of legal obligation, or opinio juris. Faced with a relative vacuum of public State practice and opinio juris concerning cyber activities, others have sought to fill the void with their views on how international law applies in this area. The most prominent and comprehensive of these efforts is the Tallinn Manual project. Although this is an initiative of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, it is neither State-led nor an official NATO project. Instead, the project is a non-governmental effort by international lawyers who first set out to identify the international legal rules applicable to cyber warfare, which led to the publication of “Tallinn Manual 1.0” in 2013. The group is now examining the international legal framework that applies to cyber activities below the threshold of the use of force and outside of the context of armed conflict, which will result in the publication of a “Tallinn Manual 2.0” by the end of this year. I commend the Tallinn Manual project team on what has clearly been a tremendous and thoughtful effort. The United States has unequivocally been in accord with the underlying premise of this project, which is that existing international law applies to State behavior in cyberspace. In this respect, the Tallinn Manuals will make a valuable contribution to underscoring and demonstrating this point across a number of bodies of international law, even if we do not necessarily agree with every aspect of the Manuals. States must also address these challenging issues. Interpretations or applications of international law proposed by non-governmental groups may not reflect the practice or legal views of many or most States. States’ relative silence could lead to unpredictability in the cyber realm, where States may be left guessing about each other’s views on the applicable legal framework. In the context of a specific cyber incident, this uncertainty could give rise to misperceptions and miscalculations by States, potentially leading to escalation and, in the worst case, conflict. To mitigate these risks, States should publicly state their views on how existing international law applies to State conduct in cyberspace to the greatest extent possible in international and domestic forums. Specific cyber incidents provide States with opportunities to do this, but it is equally important—and often easier—for States to articulate public views outside of the context of specific cyber operations or incidents. Stating such views publicly will help give rise to more settled expectations of State behavior and thereby contribute to greater predictability and stability in cyberspace. This is true for the question of what legal rules apply to cyber activity that may constitute a use of force, or that may take place in a situation of armed conflict. It is equally true regarding the question of what legal rules apply to cyber activities that fall below the threshold of the use of force and take place outside of the context of armed conflict. Although many States, including the United States, generally believe that the existing international legal framework is sufficient to regulate State behavior in cyberspace, States likely have divergent views on specific issues. Further discussion, clarification, and cooperation on these issues remains necessary. The present task is for States to begin to make public their views on how existing international law applies. In this spirit, and building on Harold Koh’s remarks in 2012 and the United States’ 2014 and 2016 submissions to the UN GGE, I would like to offer some additional U.S. views on how certain rules of international law apply to States’ behavior in cyberspace, beginning first with cyber operations during armed conflict, and then turning to the identification of voluntary, non-binding norms applicable to State behavior during peacetime. Cyber Operations in the Context of Armed Conflict. Turning to cyber operations in armed conflict, I would like to start with the U.S. military’s cyber operations in the context of the ongoing armed conflict with the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). As U.S. Defense Secretary Ashton Carter informed Congress in April 2016, U.S. Cyber Command has been asked “to take on the war against ISIL as essentially [its] first major combat operation […] The objectives there are to interrupt ISIL command-and-control, interrupt its ability to move money around, interrupt its ability to tyrannize and control population[s], [and] interrupt its ability to recruit externally.” The U.S. military must comply with the United States’ obligations under the law of armed conflict and other applicable international law when conducting cyber operations against ISIL, just as it does when conducting other types of military operations during armed conflict. To the extent that such cyber operations constitute “attacks” under the law of armed conflict, the rules on conducting attacks must be applied to those cyber operations. For example, such operations must only be directed against military objectives, such as computers, other networked devices, or possibly specific data that, by their nature, location, purpose, or use, make an effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction, capture, or neutralization, in the circumstances ruling at the time, offers a definite military advantage. Such operations also must comport with the requirements of the principles of distinction and proportionality. Feasible precautions must be taken to reduce the risk of incidental harm to civilian infrastructure and users. In the cyber context, this requires parties to a conflict to assess the potential effects of cyber activities on both military and civilian infrastructure and users. Not all cyber operations, however, rise to the level of an “attack” as a legal matter under the law of armed conflict. When determining whether a cyber activity constitutes an “attack” for purposes of the law of armed conflict, States should consider, among other things, whether a cyber activity results in kinetic or non-kinetic effects, and the nature and scope of those effects, as well as the nature of the connection, if any, between the cyber activity and the particular armed conflict in question. Even if they do not rise to the level of an “attack” under the law of armed conflict, cyber operations during armed conflict must nonetheless be consistent with the principle of military necessity. For example, a cyber operation that would not constitute an “attack,” but would nonetheless seize or destroy enemy property, would have to be imperatively demanded by the necessities of war. Additionally, even if a cyber operation does not rise to the level of an “attack” or does not cause injury or damage that would need to be considered under the principle of proportionality in conducting attacks, that cyber operation still should comport with the general principles of the law of war. Other international legal principles beyond the rules and principles of the law of armed conflict that I just discussed are also relevant to U.S. cyber operations undertaken during armed conflict. As then-Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism John Brennan said in his September 2011 remarks at Harvard Law School, “[i]nternational legal principles, including respect for a State’s sovereignty […], impose important constraints on our ability to act unilaterally […] in foreign territories.” It is to this topic—the role played by State sovereignty in the legal analysis of cyber operations—that I’d like to turn now. Sovereignty and Cyberspace. In his remarks in 2012, Harold Koh stated that “States conducting activities in cyberspace must take into account the sovereignty of other States, including outside the context of armed conflict.” I would like to build on that statement and offer a few thoughts about the relevance of sovereignty principles to States’ cyber activities. As an initial matter, remote cyber operations involving computers or other networked devices located on another State’s territory do not constitute a per se violation of international law. In other words, there is no absolute prohibition on such operations as a matter of international law. This is perhaps most clear where such activities in another State’s territory have no effects or de minimis effects. Most States, including the United States, engage in intelligence collection abroad. As President Obama said, the collection of intelligence overseas is “not unique to America.” As the President has also affirmed, the United States, like other nations, has gathered intelligence throughout its history to ensure that national security and foreign policy decisionmakers have access to timely, accurate, and insightful information. Indeed, the President issued a directive in 2014 to clarify the principles that would be followed by the United States in undertaking the collection of signals intelligence abroad. Such widespread and perhaps nearly universal practice by States of intelligence collection abroad indicates that there is no per se prohibition on such activities under customary international law. I would caution, however, that because “intelligence collection” is not a defined term, the absence of a per se prohibition on these activities does not settle the question of whether a specific intelligence collection activity might nonetheless violate a provision of international law. Although certain activities—including cyber operations—may violate another State’s domestic law, that is a separate question from whether such activities violate international law. The United States is deeply respectful of other States’ sovereign authority to prescribe laws governing activities in their territory. Disrespecting another State’s domestic laws can have serious legal and foreign policy consequences. As a legal matter, such an action could result in the criminal prosecution and punishment of a State’s agents in the United States or abroad, for example, for offenses such as espionage or for violations of foreign analogs to provisions such as the U.S. Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. From a foreign policy perspective, one can look to the consequences that flow from disclosures related to such programs. But such domestic law and foreign policy issues do not resolve the independent question of whether the activity violates international law. In certain circumstances, one State’s non-consensual cyber operation in another State’s territory could violate international law, even if it falls below the threshold of a use of force. This is a challenging area of the law that raises difficult questions. The very design of the Internet may lead to some encroachment on other sovereign jurisdictions. Precisely when a non-consensual cyber operation violates the sovereignty of another State is a question lawyers within the U.S. government continue to study carefully, and it is one that ultimately will be resolved through the practice and opinio juris of States. Relatedly, consider the challenges we face in clarifying the international law prohibition on unlawful intervention. As articulated by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in its judgment on the merits in the Nicaragua Case, this rule of customary international law forbids States from engaging in coercive action that bears on a matter that each State is entitled, by the principle of State sovereignty, to decide freely, such as the choice of a political, economic, social, and cultural system. This is generally viewed as a relatively narrow rule of customary international law, but States’ cyber activities could run afoul of this prohibition. For example, a cyber operation by a State that interferes with another country’s ability to hold an election or that manipulates another country’s election results would be a clear violation of the rule of non-intervention. For increased transparency, States need to do more work to clarify how the international law on non-intervention applies to States’ activities in cyberspace. Some may ask why it matters where the international community draws these legal lines. Put starkly, why does it matter whether an activity violates international law? It matters, of course, because the community of nations has committed to abide by international law, including with respect to activities in cyberspace. International law enables States to work together to meet common goals, including the pursuit of stability in cyberspace. And international law sets binding standards of State behavior that not only induce compliance by States but also provide compliant States with a stronger basis for criticizing—and rallying others to respond to—States that violate those standards. As Harold Koh stated in 2012, “[i]f we succeed in promoting a culture of compliance, we will reap the benefits. And if we earn a reputation for compliance, the actions we do take will earn enhanced legitimacy worldwide for their adherence to the rule of law.” Working to clarify how international law applies to States’ activities in cyberspace serves those ends, as it does in so many other critical areas of State activity. Before leaving the topic of sovereignty, I’d like to address one additional related issue involving a State’s control over cyber infrastructure and activities within, rather than outside, its territory. In his 2012 speech, Koh observed that “[t]he physical infrastructure that supports the Internet and cyber activities is generally located in sovereign territory and is subject to the jurisdiction of the territorial State.” However, he went on to emphasize that “[t]he exercise of jurisdiction by the territorial State, however, is not unlimited; it must be consistent with applicable international law, including international human rights obligations.” I want to underscore this important point. Some States invoke the concept of State sovereignty as a justification for excessive regulation of online content, including censorship and access restrictions, often undertaken in the name of counterterrorism or “countering violent extremism.” And sometimes, States also deploy the concept of State sovereignty in an attempt to shield themselves from outside criticism. So let me repeat what Koh made clear: Any regulation by a State of matters within its territory, including use of and access to the Internet, must comply with that State’s applicable obligations under international human rights law. There is no doubt that terrorist groups have become dangerously adept at using the Internet and other communications technologies to propagate their hateful messages, recruit adherents, and urge followers to commit violent acts. This is why all governments must work together to target online criminal activities—such as illicit money transfers, terrorist attack planning and coordination, criminal solicitation, and the provision of material support to terrorist groups. U.S. efforts to prevent the Internet from being used for terrorist purposes also focus on criminal activities that facilitate terrorism, such as financing and recruitment, not on restricting expressive content, even if that content is repugnant or inimical to our core values. Such efforts must not be conflated with broader calls to restrict public access to or censor the Internet, or even—as some have suggested—to effectively shut down entire portions of the Web. Such measures would not advance our security, and they would be inconsistent with our values. The Internet must remain open to the free flow of information and ideas. Restricting the flow of ideas also inhibits spreading the values of understanding and mutual respect that offer one of the most powerful antidotes to the hateful and violent narratives propagated by terrorist groups. That is why the United States holds the view that use of the Internet, including social media, in furtherance of terrorism and other criminal activity must be addressed through lawful means that respect each State’s international obligations and commitments regarding human rights, including the freedom of expression, and that serve the objectives of the free flow of information and a free and open Internet. To be sure, the incitement of imminent terrorist violence may be restricted. However, certain censorship and content control, including blocking websites simply because they contain content that criticizes a leader, a government policy, or an ideology, or because the content espouses particular religious beliefs, violates international human rights law and must not be engaged in by States. State Responsibility and the “Problem of Attribution” in Cyberspace. I have been talking thus far about States’ activities and operations in cyberspace. But as many of you know, it is often difficult to detect who or what is responsible for a given cyber incident. This leads me to the frequently raised and much debated “problem of attribution” in cyberspace. States and commentators often express concerns about the challenge of attribution in a technical sense—that is, the challenge of obtaining facts, whether through technical indicators or all-source intelligence, that would inform a State’s determinations about a particular cyber incident. Others have raised issues related to political decisions about attribution—that is, considerations that might be relevant to a State’s decision to go public and identify another State as the actor responsible for a particular cyber incident and to condemn that act as unacceptable. These technical and policy discussions about attribution, however, should be distinguished from the legal questions about attribution. In my present remarks, I will focus on the issue of attribution in the legal sense. From a legal perspective, the customary international law of state responsibility supplies the standards for attributing acts, including cyber acts, to States. For example, cyber operations conducted by organs of a State or by persons or entities empowered by domestic law to exercise governmental authority are attributable to that State, if such organs, persons, or entities are acting in that capacity. Additionally, cyber operations conducted by non-State actors are attributable to a State under the law of state responsibility when such actors engage in operations pursuant to the State’s instructions or under the State’s direction or control, or when the State later acknowledges and adopts the operations as its own. Thus, as a legal matter, States cannot escape responsibility for internationally wrongful cyber acts by perpetrating them through proxies. When there is information—whether obtained through technical means or all-source intelligence—that permits a cyber act engaged in by a non-State actor to be attributed legally to a State under one of the standards set forth in the law of state responsibility, the victim State has all of the rights and remedies against the responsible State allowed under international law. The law of state responsibility does not set forth explicit burdens or standards of proof for making a determination about legal attribution. In this context, a State acts as its own judge of the facts and may make a unilateral determination with respect to attribution of a cyber operation to another State. Absolute certainty is not—and cannot be—required. Instead, international law generally requires that States act reasonably under the circumstances when they gather information and draw conclusions based on that information. I also want to note that, despite the suggestion by some States to the contrary, there is no international legal obligation to reveal evidence on which attribution is based prior to taking appropriate action. There may, of course, be political pressure to do so, and States may choose to reveal such evidence to convince other States to join them in condemnation, for example. But that is a policy choice—it is not compelled by international law. Countermeasures and Other “Defensive” Measures. I want to turn now to the question of what options a victim State might have to respond to malicious cyber activity that falls below the threshold of an armed attack. As an initial matter, a State can always undertake unfriendly acts that are not inconsistent with any of its international obligations in order to influence the behavior of other States. Such acts—which are known as acts of retorsion—may include, for example, the imposition of sanctions or the declaration that a diplomat is persona non grata. In certain circumstances, a State may take action that would otherwise violate international law in response to malicious cyber activity. One example is the use of force in self-defense in response to an actual or imminent armed attack. Another example is that, in exceptional circumstances, a State may be able to avail itself of the plea of necessity, which, subject to certain conditions, might preclude the wrongfulness of an act if the act is the only way for the State to safeguard an essential interest against a grave and imminent peril. In the time that remains, however, I would like to talk about a type of State response that has received a lot of attention in discussions about cyberspace: countermeasures. The customary international law doctrine of countermeasures permits a State that is the victim of an internationally wrongful act of another State to take otherwise unlawful measures against the responsible State in order to cause that State to comply with its international obligations, for example, the obligation to cease its internationally wrongful act. Therefore, as a threshold matter, the availability of countermeasures to address malicious cyber activity requires a prior internationally wrongful act that is attributable to another State. As with all countermeasures, this puts the responding State in the position of potentially being held responsible for violating international law if it turns out that there wasn’t actually an internationally wrongful act that triggered the right to take countermeasures, or if the responding State made an inaccurate attribution determination. That is one reason why countermeasures should not be engaged in lightly. Additionally, under the law of countermeasures, measures undertaken in response to an internationally wrongful act performed in or through cyberspace that is attributable to a State must be directed only at the State responsible for the wrongful act and must meet the principles of necessity and proportionality, including the requirements that a countermeasure must be designed to cause the State to comply with its international obligations—for example, the obligation to cease its internationally wrongful act—and must cease as soon as the offending State begins complying with the obligations in question. The doctrine of countermeasures also generally requires the injured State to call upon the responsible State to comply with its international obligations before a countermeasure may be taken—in other words, the doctrine generally requires what I will call a “prior demand.” The sufficiency of a prior demand should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis in light of the particular circumstances of the situation at hand and the purpose of the requirement, which is to give the responsible State notice of the injured State’s claim and an opportunity to respond. I also should note that countermeasures taken in response to internationally wrongful cyber activities attributable to a State generally may take the form of cyber-based countermeasures or non-cyber-based countermeasures. That is a decision typically within the discretion of the responding State and will depend on the circumstances. Voluntary, Non-Binding Norms of Responsible State Behavior in Peacetime. In the remainder of my remarks, I’d like to discuss very briefly another element of the United States’ strategic framework for international cyber stability: the development of international consensus on certain additional voluntary, non-binding norms of responsible State behavior in cyberspace that apply during peacetime. Internationally, the United States has identified and promoted four such norms: First, a State should not conduct or knowingly support cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property, trade secrets, or other confidential business information with the intent of providing competitive advantages to its companies or commercial sectors. Second, a State should not conduct or knowingly support online activity that intentionally damages critical infrastructure or otherwise impairs the use of critical infrastructure to provide service to the public. Third, a State should not conduct or knowingly support activity intended to prevent national computer security incident response teams (CSIRTs) from responding to cyber incidents. A State also should not use CSIRTs to enable online activity that is intended to do harm. Fourth, a State should cooperate, in a manner consistent with its domestic and international obligations, with requests for assistance from other States in investigating cyber crimes, collecting electronic evidence, and mitigating malicious cyber activity emanating from its territory. These four U.S.-promoted norms seek to address specific areas of risk that are of national and/or economic security concern to all States. Although voluntary and non-binding in nature, these norms can serve to define an international standard of behavior to be observed by responsible, like-minded States with the goal of preventing bad actors from engaging in malicious cyber activity. If observed, these measures—which can include measures of self-restraint—can contribute substantially to conflict prevention and stability. Over time, these norms can potentially provide common standards for responsible States to use to identify and respond to behavior that deviates from these norms. As more States commit to observing these norms, they will be increasingly willing to condemn the malicious activities of bad actors and to join together to ensure that there are consequences for those activities. It is important, however, to distinguish clearly between international law, on the one hand, and voluntary, non-binding norms on the other. These four norms identified by the United States, or the other peacetime cyber norms recommended in the 2015 UN GGE report, fall squarely in the voluntary, non-binding category. These voluntary, non-binding norms set out standards of expected State behavior that may, in certain circumstances, overlap with standards of behavior that are required as a matter of international law. Such norms are intended to supplement existing international law. They are designed to address certain cyber activities by States that occur outside of the context of armed conflict that are potentially destabilizing. That said, it is possible that if States begin to accept the standards set out in such non-binding norms as legally required and act in conformity with them, such norms could, over time, crystallize into binding customary international law. As a result, States should approach the process of identifying and committing to such non-binding norms with care. In closing, I wanted to highlight a few points. First, cyberspace may be a relatively new frontier, but State behavior in cyberspace, as in other areas, remains embedded in an existing framework of law, including international law. Second, States have the primary responsibility for identifying how existing legal frameworks apply in cyberspace. Third, States have a responsibility to publicly articulate applicable standards. This is critical to enable an accurate understanding of international law, in the area of cyberspace and beyond. I hope that these remarks have furthered this goal of transparency, and highlighted the important role of international law, and international lawyers, in this important and dynamic area. Thank you for bearing with me, and I would be happy to field a few questions.

TITLE: Keynote Address at the Singapore International Cyber Week

TEXT: Good morning! Thank you to Prime Minister Lee and the Government of Singapore for inviting me to speak at this the inaugural Singapore International Cyber Week. It is also worth noting that this event is happening during the 25th anniversary of GovernmentWare conference, which is recognized as one of the premier global conferences. Therefore I am honored to have the opportunity to speak with you today. I am equally happy to be here in Singapore again. This amazing city wows me each time I visit. My first visit was as a speaker at the International Association of Prosecutors conference many years ago. I saw then how much potential this nation and its people possessed, so it is truly a pleasure to return and witness the incredible advances that Singapore has made. I also greatly appreciate the opportunity to engage with key partners on cyber issues – many of whom are represented in this room. As with our other partners, the United States works closely with Singapore on a range of issues, including cybersecurity. The inclusion of cyber commitments in President Obama and Prime Minister Lee’s Official Joint Statement this summer and the cybersecurity memorandum of understanding we signed underscore the growing importance of cyber cooperation between our two countries. We also work with the Association for Southeast Asian Nations and other global partners to promote the social and economic benefits inherent to cyberspace. At the U.S.-ASEAN Summits at Sunnylands and in Vientiane this year, our nations affirmed a shared commitment to promote security and stability in cyberspace consistent with norms of responsible state behavior. These are just a few examples of how we and our partners are working to promote an open, interoperable, secure, and reliable cyberspace. In reviewing the theme for this week – Building a Secure and Resilient Digital Future through Partnership- I was glad to see the emphasis placed on building international partnerships in cyberspace. This has been one of the key priorities for my office at the U.S. Department of State since its founding in 2011. While five years doesn’t seem that long ago, some might be surprised to know that mine was the first office dedicated to cyber policy within a Foreign Ministry. With a small staff and a large mission, we set out to develop key global partnerships that would support us in enhancing our nation’s cybersecurity. Since then, about twenty-five other nations have created similar offices in response to the shifting landscape that has accompanied the growth and expansion of the Internet. Many of those nations are represented in this room; therefore I know that many of you will agree that cyber issues are cross cutting issues. In other words, our economic, political, and social welfare cannot thrive if we fail to protect the information infrastructure that has become so vital to daily life. Our businesses and citizens have come to depend on an Internet that is open, interoperable, secure, and reliable. It allows them to create and innovate in ways that we could not have dreamed of a decade ago. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry put it this way, “…the internet revolution that we are living today will literally define the kinds of opportunities that young people all over the world are hoping for today – help strengthen governments; provide opportunity; make us safer; bring us together; and in effect, define the future of this century.” If we acknowledge just how vital digital technology and connectivity are to our present and future, then we must also recognize that there are, and will continue to be, malicious actors who seek to take advantage of our digital reality. This brings me to a question that I am regularly asked by the media. How do we deal with the growing number of threats to networks and infrastructure? I’m sure that some of you are also being asked that question. I also know you are all keenly aware of the variety of the threats we face in cyberspace. There are operational threats to our cyber networks that, whether state-sponsored or criminal in nature, can potentially harm our security and do substantial damage to our infrastructure and economic interests. There are also threats from large-scale cyber intruders for purposes of stealing intellectual property, trade secrets, proprietary technology and sensitive business information from the private sector for commercial gain. Threats come in a wide range of malicious cyber activities, like ransomware, which is used to extort a single individual or hold hostage sensitive information, like the medical records of every patient in an entire hospital system. Cyber threats are not contained within geo-political borders and it is clear to me that no nation is immune and no system is impenetrable. In order to effectively address these challenges, it is vitally important to foster a whole-of-government approach. At the State Department, we work closely with our interagency partners to ensure that our foreign policy positions on cross-cutting cyber issues are fully synchronized. For this reason, President Obama recently approved Presidential Policy Directive 41 on U.S. Cyber Incident Coordination. This Directive marks a major milestone in codifying the policy that governs the U.S. federal government’s response to significant cyber incidents and assists in facilitating cooperation on incident response across the interagency. To prevent cyber incidents before they take place, we recognize that it is crucial to elevate cyber issues throughout international engagements to promote global cooperation, and to ensure that states take the threats seriously. It is equally important to build consensus on voluntary peacetime norms of responsible state conduct in cyberspace that enhance international security; and to address malicious activities at every level. These steps are part of how the United States supports a strategic framework of international cyber stability, designed to achieve and maintain a peaceful cyberspace environment where all states are able to fully realize its benefits. A cyberspace where there are advantages to cooperating against common threats and avoiding conflict; and where there is little incentive for states to engage in disruptive behavior or attack one another. This strategic framework has three key pillars: Global affirmation of the applicability of international law to state behavior in cyberspace; The development of international consensus on certain voluntary norms of responsible state behavior in cyberspace that apply during peacetime; and The development and implementation of practical confidence-building measures (CBMs) that can help ensure stability in cyberspace by reducing the risk of misperception and escalation. We have forged a growing international consensus on this framework, and will continue to promote a broad consensus on international cyber stability wherever possible. Expanding on this consensus is a core diplomatic priority for the United States. To that end, we have raised and will continue raising these issues at a high level in key bilateral and multilateral engagements with countries around the globe. We are pleased that Singapore and many of the countries represented here have joined us in this effort. The first and most fundamental pillar of our framework for international cyber stability is the applicability of existing international law to state behavior in cyberspace. The report of the 2013 United Nations Group of Governmental Experts, or GGE as it’s known, was a landmark achievement that affirmed the applicability of existing international law, including the UN Charter, to state conduct in cyberspace. Two years later the 2015 GGE report made a significant achievement with its recommendations for voluntary norms of state behavior in cyberspace in peacetime, which included concepts championed by the United States. G20 leaders furthered this work when, at their November 2015 meeting, they issued a strong statement affirming that all states should be guided in their use of information and communications technologies by the 2015 report. The 2013 and 2015 reports underscored that states must act in cyberspace under the established international obligations and commitments that have guided their actions for decades – in peacetime and during conflict – and must meet their international obligations regarding internationally wrongful acts attributable to them. Within the Asia Pacific region, there is a lot of potential to strengthen cooperation on practical transparency and confidence-building measures. These measures can build trust and competence to reduce the risk of misperception and instability. They can be defined in three categories: transparency measures that give greater predictability and clarity to state behavior; cooperative measures that would allow like-minded states to work together against common non-state threats, even to address specific cyber problems of concern, such as: bot-nets, zero day exploits, and threats to critical civilian cyber-controlled infrastructures; and confidence- and security-building measures. Similar measures have been used for decades to address issues of political-military concern between states and they can do the same in cyberspace. While establishing a framework for international security is imperative, building on the consensus achieved to date with respect to international law and voluntary peacetime norms is necessary, and strengthening transparency and confidence is vital; it is also important to build capacity and raise awareness on cyber issues. That is why throughout October – U.S. Cybersecurity Awareness Month – the United States is partnering with key organizations like the Global Forum on Cyber Expertise and supporting national awareness campaigns – like our national Stop Think Connect campaign. This campaign empowers businesses, governments, and individuals to adopt safer and more secure practices online. I encourage each of you to join with us in this effort by going to Stop Think Connect [dot] org and becoming a partner. As the theme for this week highlights, our digital future will depend on partnership – and through partnership we can make a difference in the world of online safety and cybersecurity. Thank you again to our Singaporean hosts and I look forward to engaging with everyone over the next few days.

TITLE: Video Remarks on Cybersecurity Awareness Month 2016

TEXT: Hello, My name is Chris Painter, and I am the Coordinator for Cyber Issues here at the U.S. Department of State. As you may know, in partnership with other countries, the State Department is leading the U.S. Government’s efforts to promote an open, interoperable, secure, and reliable Internet that supports international trade and commerce, strengthens international security, and fosters free expression and innovation. Our guiding principles and priorities are outlined in the U.S. International Strategy for Cyberspace. Under the Strategy, we work with other countries to: 1. Promote Norms and Build International Stability in Cyberspace 2. Deter cybercrime 3. Strengthen Internet public policy and governance 4. Support Internet freedom 5. Develop information and communication technologies for economic growth and social development 6. Promote cybersecurity due diligence AND 7. All of these efforts help us build capacity, security, and prosperity with our global partners. As a founding member of the Global Forum on Cyber Expertise, we joined Canada and the Organization for American States in an Initiative to raise global awareness of cyber threats and support national awareness campaigns, like our national Stop Think Connect campaign. This campaign empowers businesses, governments, and individuals to adopt safer and more secure practices online. To achieve these goals, for Cybersecurity Month this year, we are asking you to join us in building cybersecurity capacity and awareness around the world. How can you participate? I’m glad you asked. Here are a few ideas: FIRST, whether you work in government, the private sector, or in civil society you can look for ways to improve your personal and workplace cyber hygiene by using stronger passwords and securing your online accounts through the use of multi-factor authentication. SECOND, you can contribute to building a culture of cybersecurity by encouraging your colleagues and leaders to develop security awareness programs in your workplace that address the risks in cyberspace. You can visit StopThinkConnect.org for more info. THIRD, on a policy level, you can work to make sure your government elevates cyber issues as a national priority – because these are not just technical issues anymore, but core issues of national security, economic policy, human rights and, what I do, foreign policy. So all stakeholders – government, the private sector and civil society – should work together to create comprehensive national cyber strategies and raise awareness on these issues. And finally, you can follow my office on twitter @State_Cyber and #CyberAware for daily updates. Thank you for your attention and we look forward to your support throughout October as we increase global cyber capacity and awareness!

TITLE: The Persistent Threat of North Korea and Developing an Effective U.S. Response

TEXT: Introduction. Chairman Gardner, Ranking Member Cardin, and Members of the Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today to testify about the U.S. response to the threat from North Korea. The Challenge Posed by a Belligerent North Korea. The continued development of North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs is a threat to the United States homeland, our allies, and the peace, security, and stability of the region. Two nuclear tests and an unprecedented series of ballistic missile launches this year flagrantly violate United Nations Security Council Resolutions (UNSCRs). Moreover, North Korea has repeatedly threatened to attack the United States and our allies with nuclear weapons. The threats have become more frequent and the rhetoric more alarming. Mere days ago, North Korea’s foreign minister delivered a defiant speech to the UN General Assembly, stating that the United States will “face consequences beyond imagination” from North Korea. During August’s annual military exercise with the Republic of Korea (R.O.K.) and following the announcement of the planned deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Aerial Defense (THAAD) system, Pyongyang explicitly warned of pre-emptive nuclear strikes against the United States and our allies. Significant advances in North Korea’s nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles programs underpin this bellicosity. These programs are funded at the cost of the well-being of the North Korean people, who suffer economic deprivation and horrific human rights abuses at the hands of the Kim Jong Un regime. Our Comprehensive North Korea Policy. The goal of our policy towards North Korea is the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula in a peaceful manner. The North Korea itself committed to this goal in the September 19, 2005 Joint Statement of the Six-Party Talks. However, since making that pledge, North Korea abandoned the Six-Party Talks, rejected negotiations on denuclearization, and conducted five nuclear tests and a series of ballistic missile launches, in flagrant violation of its international obligations and commitments. Our policy is grounded in three tracks: deterrence, pressure, and diplomacy. It seeks to convince Pyongyang to return to the negotiating table and agree to complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization. To deter a North Korean attack, we maintain a strong defensive military posture, rooted in our ironclad alliances with the R.O.K. and Japan. We consistently and publicly reaffirm our commitment to our Allies and continue to work with the R.O.K. and Japan to develop a comprehensive set of Alliance capabilities to counter the multiple threats, including in particular the North Korean ballistic missile threat. We have pursued a comprehensive, sustained pressure campaign – of which sanctions are a key part. The goal of this pressure is to raise the cost to North Korea for violating international law and to impede the North’s ability to participate in or to fund its unlawful activities. We are steadily tightening sanctions in an effort to compel the Kim regime to return to credible negotiations on denuclearization by targeting the regime’s revenue and reputation. We have made repeated diplomatic overtures to North Korea signaling our commitment to the 2005 Joint Statement and our willingness to engage in credible and authentic talks aimed at restarting negotiations on denuclearization. We also are engaged in diplomatic effort to build more rigorous and universal enforcement of Resolution 2270’s sanctions measures, and to block illicit North Korean WMD and proliferation-related actions. North Korea views diplomatic meetings and visits as important markers of its international legitimacy. This month, we instructed our embassies around the world to ask host governments to condemn the test and take further additional actions to downgrade or sever diplomatic and economic ties. As of September 25, 75 countries have issued statements condemning the test and several others have cancelled or downgraded planned meetings or visits with officials from North Korea. Sanctions as a Foreign Policy Tool. Sanctions are an important component of our strategy for impeding the D.P.R.K.’s unlawful programs and, ultimately, compelling it to negotiate a freeze, rollback, and elimination of its nuclear program. The sanctions applied to date have created significant problems for the North Korean regime, but they have not yet caused the D.P.R.K. to change course. The Administration in close coordination with our key allies is continually examining our sanctions toolkit and identifying ways to improve their efficacy. North Korea poses particular challenges from a sanctions perspective, given its relative economic isolation. Unlike Iran, whose mid-sized economy was predicated on an industry that needed access to the international financial system, North Korea is one of the least developed economies on the planet. The country prides itself on an ideology which values self-reliance above all. This isolation and economic immaturity preclude a sanctions response based solely on U.S. domestic authorities. North Korea’s economy is heavily dependent on China. The Administration has engaged Beijing at the highest levels to seek greater Chinese cooperation is imposing costs on North Korea for its threatening behavior. We regularly urge China to do more to prevent North Korea from using Chinese companies or infrastructure in ways that can benefit the D.P.R.K.’s illicit activities. We have also taken a number of actions in conjunction with partners around the world to close off revenue streams from outside China. Multilateral Sanctions through UN Security Council Resolutions. UN Security Council Resolutions have played an important role in our pressure campaign on North Korea, because they have the power to impose universally binding sanctions. The five UNSCRs on North Korea (1695, 1718, 1874, 2087, and 2094) adopted between 2006 and 2013 target North Korea’s missile and nuclear programs. While these resolutions have an impact, their targets were narrowly focused. However, in March 2016, UNSCR 2270 imposed for the first time measures targeting economic activities that support the Kim regime broadly, not just revenue streams directly connected to the nuclear and ballistic missile programs. UNSCR 2270 includes unprecedented inspection and financial provisions, including mandatory inspections of cargo to and from North Korea, and a requirement to terminate banking relationships with North Korean financial institutions. In order to maximize global implementation of UNSCR 2270, the Administration has strengthened efforts to provide information and expertise to the Security Council’s North Korea Sanctions Committee and its Panel of Experts. We continue to engage in vigorous outreach to member states to highlight these new international obligations, build capacity globally, and bring attention to implementation gaps. U.S. Authorities and Other National Sanctions. In the wake of the January 2016 nuclear test, Congress and the Administration worked together to adopt broad domestic authorities that operate on the principle that we must go after all revenue streams that support the Kim regime. The North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act (NKSPEA or the Act) was signed by President Obama in February 2016. In the seven months since its enactment, the Administration has been vigorously implementing the Act. March 15: The President issues EO 13722, which implements aspects of NKSPEA. The Treasury Department makes 12 additions to the Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list, consistent with authorities outlined in NKSPEA. The State Department designates five North Korean individuals and entities under EO (Executive Order) 13382, which targets Weapons of Mass Destruction proliferators and their supporters May 17: The State Department publishes an enhanced travel warning with respect to North Korea. June 2: The Treasury Department identifies North Korea as a jurisdiction of primary money laundering concern, and proposes new prohibitions on North Korean banking activity. June 9: The State Department transmits a Report to Congress on actions taken to implement the U.S. strategy to improve international implementation of UN sanctions on North Korea. June 30: The Treasury Department, with support from the State Department and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, submits a report to Congress on North Korea’s activities undermining cybersecurity, as one of a number of reports mandated by the Act. In the report, the State Department outlines the U.S. government’s strategy to engage foreign partners to combat such activity. July 6: The State Department publishes the NKSPEA-mandated Report to Congress on human rights abuses in North Korea. Based in part on information contained in the report, the Treasury Department makes 16 additions to the SDN list, including Kim Jong Un. August 11: The State Department transmits a Report to Congress on U.S. policy toward North Korea based on a complete interagency review of policy alternatives. August 24: The State Department transmits a Report to Congress regarding the U.S. strategy to promote initiatives to enhance international awareness and address the human rights situation in North Korea. September 1: The State Department transmits a Report to Congress detailing a plan for making unrestricted, unmonitored, and inexpensive mass communication available to the people of North Korea. September 26: The Treasury Department designates four Chinese nationals and one entity complicit in sanctions evasion activities, consistent with mandatory sanctions in the Act. Further, our partners and allies around the world have also implemented their own strong domestic sanctions regimes, going far beyond that required by UNSCRs. These include South Korea, Australia, Japan, Canada, the EU, and other countries. Progress. Our diplomatic campaign to leverage UNSCRs, other multilateral efforts, and national authorities has produced results. Recent successes include: The operations of North Korea’s UN-designated shipping line, Ocean Maritime Management Company have been essentially shut down and its ships are denied access to ports, scrapped, impounded, or confined to their homeports. Air Koryo’s landing privileges at foreign airports have been reduced. Several governments have imposed visa restrictions on North Korean passport holders. South Korea closed the Kaesong Industrial Park in February 2016, closing off an important source of foreign currency to the regime. Bangladesh, South Africa, Burma, and other countries have expelled North Korean diplomats involved in illicit activities. Taiwan has halted its imports of North Korean coal. Malta ended its visa extensions for North Korean workers. Mongolia de-flagged North Korean ships and Cambodia recently instituted rules prohibiting foreign-owned ships from flying the Cambodian flag. As recently as June 2016, the State Department used the Iran, North Korea, and Syria Nonproliferation Act (INKSNA) to impose additional sanctions on North Korean persons for their proliferation activities. Challenges. There is more to do. North Korea’s coal exports, mostly to China, generate over $1 billion in revenue for the regime annually and account for about a third of all export income. We are working to build on previous UNSCRs to address loopholes that allow North Korea to export coal and iron ore, earning precious foreign currency for the Kim regime on the backs of enslaved workers, including children. North Korea’s shipping lines limp along, despite years of sanctions and key victories like the seizure of arms aboard the Chong Chon Gang and the impoundment of the Mu Du Bong. North Korea’s export of labor continues to provide a source of revenue for the regime. We are not yet satisfied and believe there is more we can do. Much will depend on China, which is by far North Korea’s greatest trading partner. China consistently says that it opposes North Korea’s ballistic missile launches and nuclear weapons programs. China has supported the adoption of UNSCRs on North Korea, including UNSCR 2270. China also supported the Security Council’s press statement in response to the latest nuclear test, which stated that the Security Council will begin work immediately on sanctions in a new Security Council resolution. Securing increased cooperation and application of pressure on North Korea is a major goal of our diplomacy with China. We recognize China’s concerns that pressure on North Korea could precipitate a crisis, but we point out that its nuclear and missile programs pose a far greater threat to regional security. We acknowledge China’s steps to implement UN sanctions but repeatedly urge China to improve implementation and apply pressure needed to effect a change in North Korean behavior. China has objected to U.S. actions intended to strengthen our defenses against North Korean military threats to ourselves and our allies, but we make clear that we will take all necessary steps to deter and defend against those threats. We closely coordinate with China on sanctions and other measures to counter North Korea’s problematic behavior, but we have not shied away from unilateral actions against North Korean actors, including those located in China. Conclusion. Today’s hearing provides us an opportunity to send a strong, clear message of resolve to hold North Korea accountable to its commitments and international obligations. As Secretary Kerry affirmed at the UN General Assembly, every country has a responsibility to vigorously enforce UN sanctions to ensure that North Korea “pays a price for its dangerous actions.” With the UN and our allies, more remains to be done; we intend to pursue the global pressure campaign on North Korea more generally, and to urge, and where necessary push, other countries to join that effort.

TITLE: Statement Before the Presidential Commission on Enhancing National Cybersecurity

TEXT: Chairman Donilon, Vice Chairman Palmisano, and members of the Presidential Commission on Enhancing National Cybersecurity, thank you for the opportunity to speak to you. Through its diplomacy, the State Department works energetically to strengthen our collective cybersecurity. Our efforts to coordinate, consult, and negotiate with a range of countries and international organizations complement the practical, day-to-day work of our interagency colleagues who maintain network security. Our cyber diplomats work to reduce risk and enhance stability in cyberspace. These efforts include but are not limited to working with our interagency partners to promote internationally a framework for cyber stability; building the capacity of foreign governments to promote cybersecurity and respond to cyber threats; using diplomatic channels to support cyber incident response; and partnering with other countries to combat transnational cybercrime and promote membership in the Budapest Convention. In each of these areas, we take care to ensure that our policy recommendations, capacity building efforts, and foreign assistance programs respect and reinforce the rule of law, the free flow of data, and human rights, including freedom of expression. I will discuss each of these lines of effort and offer a few policy recommendations. Enhancing a Framework for International Stability in Cyberspace. To strengthen cybersecurity on the international level, the Department of State, working with our interagency partners, is guided by the President’s 2011 International Strategy for Cyberspace, which sets out a strategic framework of international cyber stability designed to achieve and maintain a peaceful cyberspace where all states are able to fully realize its benefits, where there are advantages to cooperating against common threats and avoiding conflict, and where there is little incentive for states to engage in disruptive behavior or to attack one another. This framework has three key elements: (1) affirmation that existing international law applies to state behavior in cyberspace; (2) development of an international consensus on and promotion of additional voluntary norms of responsible state behavior in cyberspace that apply during peacetime; and (3) development and implementation of practical confidence-building measures (CBMs) among states. Since 2009, the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security (UN GGE) has served as a productive and groundbreaking expert-level venue for the United States to build support for this framework through three consensus reports in 2010, 2013, and 2015. The conclusions captured in these reports have been endorsed by political leaders in a range of settings, including during the G20 summit in Antalya, Turkey, in 2015, and reaffirmed at the 2016 G20 summit in Hangzhou, China. Perhaps the most prominent bilateral statement of support for this framework came during Chinese President Xi Jinping’s state visit to Washington in September 2015, when both the United States and China committed, inter alia, that “neither country’s government will conduct or knowingly support cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property, including trade secrets or other confidential business information, with the intent of providing competitive advantages to companies or commercial sectors.” Capacity Building. The United States can more effectively respond to foreign cyber threats and transnational crime when our international partners themselves have strong incident response and cybercrime fighting capabilities. Therefore, the Department of State is working with departments and agencies, allies, and multilateral partners to build the capacity of foreign governments, particularly in developing countries, to secure their own networks as well as to investigate and prosecute cybercriminals within their borders. The Department also actively promotes donor cooperation, including bilateral and multilateral participation in joint cyber capacity building initiatives. In 2015, for example, the United States joined the Netherlands in founding the Global Forum on Cyber Expertise, a global platform for countries, international organizations, and the private sector to exchange best practices and expertise on cyber capacity building. The United States partnered with Japan, Australia, Canada, the African Union Commission, and Symantec on four cybersecurity and cybercrime capacity building initiatives. The Department also provided assistance to the Council of Europe, the Organization of American States, and the United Nations Global Program on Cybercrime, among others, to enable delivery of capacity building assistance to developing nations. Many traditional bilateral law enforcement training programs, including those focused on counterterrorism, increasingly include cyber elements, such as training investigators and prosecutors in the handling of electronic evidence. Much of our foreign law enforcement training on combatting intellectual property crime focuses on digital theft. Responding to Cyber Incidents. Over the past two years, we have witnessed a number of high-profile cyberattacks – at home and abroad – on financial institutions, private companies, government agencies, critical infrastructure, and political organizations. The United States uses a whole-of-government approach to respond to and deter malicious activities in cyberspace that brings to bear its full range of instruments of national power and corresponding policy tools – diplomatic, law enforcement, economic, military, and intelligence – as appropriate and consistent with applicable law. The State Department plays a key role in interagency deliberations on major cyber events, and it engages through diplomatic channels when needed. For example, during the 2012-2013 distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against financial institutions, diplomatic channels were used as a supplement to incident response efforts through more technical channels, ensuring that policy makers in foreign governments were aware of U.S. requests for assistance. We also have used diplomatic channels to raise concerns regarding the cyber-enabled theft of trade secrets for commercial gain. Combatting Transnational Crime. The United States is a global leader in the campaign against transnational crime. In partnership with key allies and multilateral partners, the U.S. helps countries effectively utilize existing legal tools, fund development of modern legal frameworks, provide training on cybercrime investigations, and strengthen international cooperation to combat modern, high-tech crime threats. The State Department, with its interagency partners, actively promotes membership in the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, known as the Budapest Convention, supports the Group of Seven (G7) 24/7 Network, and offers rewards for information leading to the arrest or conviction of members of transnational cybercrime organizations. Recommendations. As we look ahead, cybersecurity will continue to be a challenge for the United States when we take into consideration the rapidly expanding environment of global cyber threats, the increasing reliance on information technology, the reality that many developing nations are still in the early stages of their cyber maturity, and the ongoing and increasingly sophisticated use of information technology by terrorists and other criminals. Therefore, we offer the following recommendations for the Commission’s consideration. Efforts to further strengthen the strategic framework of international cyber stability should continue through promotion of certain voluntary norms of responsible state behavior in cyberspace that apply during peacetime; expansion of global affirmation that international law applies to state behavior in cyberspace; and development and implementation of additional confidence building measures to reduce risks of misperception and escalation. The United States pursues a vision of openness and collaborative, multi-stakeholder governance for cyberspace, in stark contrast to alternative, state-centric concepts of cyberspace governance pursued by some countries, principally China and Russia. Therefore, the United States should continue to advocate in bilateral and multilateral fora, including the United Nations, toward multi-stakeholder governance for cyberspace. The ability of the United States to respond to foreign cyber threats and promote international cyber stability is greatly enhanced by the capabilities and strength of our international partners in this area. It is essential, therefore, to continue to build the capacity of foreign governments, particularly in developing countries, to secure their own networks, and to promote donor cooperation in joint capacity building initiatives. Given the transnational nature of the Internet and related communications infrastructure, international cooperation is essential to effectively address cyber incidents. This is especially true for the most serious cyber incidents of strategic concern that require an immediate response and those with significant cross-border implications. Therefore, the United States should continue efforts to enhance its understanding of other countries’ cyber incident response and coordination capabilities and to formalize communications channels, including network defense, law enforcement, diplomatic, military, and others. To further combat transnational cybercrime, the United States should continue to expand its partnerships with allies and multilateral partners, promote membership in the Budapest Convention, enlarge the G7 24/7 Network, and target transnational cybercrime organizations. Here at home, the State Department should continue to mainstream cyberspace issues into our foreign diplomatic engagements and build the necessary internal capacity to formulate, coordinate, and implement cyber policy and execute our cyber diplomacy. Lastly, to provide additional background information for the Commission’s consideration on the State Department’s work in this area, I am including with this statement two documents we submitted to Congress earlier this year – my Senate oversight testimony and the Department of State International Cyberspace Policy Strategy. In closing, I would like to thank the Commission for giving me this opportunity to speak today, and I look forward to answering any questions you may have.

TEXT: So what do zombies have to do with diplomacy? Well, a few years ago some bad guys used tens of thousands of compromised or zombie computers located all over the world to launch an attack against a number of U.S. banks trying to knock them offline. Now, of course, we used technical means to try to respond, but we also used something new. We used diplomatic means. We contacted through diplomatic channels over 20 countries where these compromised computers were located and asked for their help. Now, asking other countries for help and trying to build a collective response to a common threat is at – it’s a common tool of diplomacy. And in this case, it turned out to be one of the most effective tools we have in mitigating the threat. Let me give you another example. Just a few months ago the leaders of the 20 largest economies got together and they agreed that international law applies in cyber space just like it does in the physical world. They also agreed that no country should steal the intellectual property of another country using cyber means to benefit their commercial sector. Now, what that means is cyber space is not some lawless zone; it’s not the wild wild web; there are some rules that apply, and that makes us all safer. That agreement too was an example of diplomacy. I’m a cyber diplomat. And before I tell you what a bunch of diplomats have to do with – I only occasionally wear a top hat now – (laughter) – have to do with the world wide web and the global internet, I want to go back in time a little bit. Back in 1970 when I was a wee lad, I went to a movie called “Colossus: The Forbin Project.” Now, this is the first movie where computers took over the world. The U.S. built Colossus to control its nuclear arsenal, take the man out of the middle, have perfect deterrence. The Soviets stole the information and they built their own computer. The two computers started talking to each other, and they decided to protect humankind from itself; they would abolish all civil liberties and freedoms and take over. Now, I confess in the fifth grade I sat through that movie for three straight showings, and back then there really wasn’t what we have today. There wasn’t the global internet. There wasn’t the world wide web. There wasn’t Facebook or Twitter. There wasn’t malicious hackers and we didn’t have internet censorship or countries talking about cyber warfare. But even back then, some of the tensions and some of the concerns we have are still tensions and concerns we have today. Even before the internet existed, we’ve always been very hopeful about the benefits that technology is conferring but at the same time very fearful that it could all go terribly, terribly wrong. In any event, after my Colossus-watching binge I was hooked. A few years later I got my first home computer, an Atari 800. (Applause.) I graduated to an Amiga 500 later, so the Atari 800 though had this – we stored everything on cassette tapes, which was truly amazing. And I really became obsessed with what technology could do. Years later after that, in the ‘90s, I became a federal prosecutor doing – dealing with this newfangled thing called cybercrime. And then about seven years ago, I went to the White House to do cyber policy. Now I’m at the State Department leading a team of cyber diplomats. I’m still very fond of computer movies. In fact, my office is festooned with over 30 movie posters where hackers or computers are the main characters – everything from War Games to the Matrix to the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, Sneakers, and of course, Colossus: The Forbin Project. But much has changed since then. Where once people thought about these cyber and internet issues as just technical issues that were the province of the technical community and the geeks, now countries and others around the world recognize that these issues are core issues of our national security, core issues of human rights, core issues of economic policy, and ultimately core issues of our foreign policy. And that makes sense because as amazing as the digital revolution has been, it’s really not about the technology itself. It’s about what people do with the technology. Today, the same technology that empowers us can be used by nation-states and criminals and terrorists to attack us. And the same technology that allows us to connect all over the world can be also be used to separate and control us. And that’s why law and policy matter, and that’s why diplomacy matters. Of course, it’s only fairly recently that the U.S. and other governments have understood that this is really a foreign policy imperative, and that’s due to a few things. First, the internet went from being an American invention to a truly global platform. And as we all became more dependent on the internet for our social and economic and political lives, governments took notice. And while many governments believe the internet is a way to – is a real boon for their social and economic growth, other governments see the internet as a threat to their stability and to their culture. And some of those governments want to change the way the internet is run. They want to impose much greater state control. But the way the internet grew up, and frankly the way the internet thrived, has been through a partnership, a real unique partnership between the private sector, civil society, the technical community, and governments – and not just governments alone. Second, we’ve come to understand that the internet and technology is not only used to promote creativity and to promote free speech, but it can also be used by states for control, as a tool for control. Certainly, in a number of countries we’ve seen the internet and these technologies be a platform to bring people together and to give them a voice in talking to their governments, but we’ve also seen repressive regimes use the technology to identify and go after dissidents. Countries like China have tried to draw and tried to build a cyber wall around their internet, because they are worried about content and what they think is destabilizing content. And even here at home, where we have strong protections for civil liberties, we are debating how we can have both security and privacy together in this new online space. Far from solving some of the age-old questions around human rights and security, the internet has just taken them global. Third, we’ve learned, as we’ve become more dependent on the internet for everything we do, we’re also more vulnerable to malicious actors who may want to steal from us or even cause worse harm. Where once computer crime was the province of lone criminals or cyber pranksters, today you have transnational organized criminal groups and even nation-states who steal our most sensitive personal and financial information. Back when I was a prosecutor, some people thought cyber-crime was kind of cool, but these days, with the string of cyber-enabled identity thefts and some of the recent things, like hackers hacking into hospitals and encrypting medical records and only decrypting them and only making them available if they get paid ransom, I think everyone’s beginning to understand how this impacts them personally. We also fear the prospect of cyber-attacks by governments, by criminals, and by terrorists on the very things that we depend on to run our day-to-day lives, like the financial system, or a recent example where hackers took down the power grid and denied power to over 200,000 people in Ukraine. And I think everyone probably remembers the North Korean cyber-attack on Sony Pictures, which was an example of a rogue state who tried to influence freedom of expression outside their borders. Now, for me who loves cyber movies, I never thought that I’d actually see an attack that was because of a movie. Finally, as more governments are developing military capabilities online, we worry about actions that could affect the entire and undermine the entire global ecosystem and actually worry that this could cause real physical conflict. These – all these trends are only increasing. This is here to stay. I often say cyber is now the new black, and we are only going to see this increase as we go forward. And they’re driving us to an inflection point where we really have to engage. But the challenges that we face in cyber space are really no different than those that we’ve had for a long time in the physical world. They are challenges of governance and of security and of human rights, and those are the challenges that we’ve always used diplomacy to address. And right now these issues are being debated in – all over the world in forums and rooms and groups that many of you probably have never heard of, but decisions are being teed up that could have real effects on both our freedoms and our security both in the online and the offline world. So cyber diplomats at the State Department and a growing cadre of cyber diplomats all over the world are engaging. We are breaking down the barriers between national security and human rights and economic issues so that we have policies to account for all of our values and priorities. We are building likeminded coalitions of countries but also of businesses and civil society. We are promoting internet freedom and pushing back against those countries who view information itself as a threat. We are working to preserve the governance system that the internet grew up with, one that involves all the various stakeholders, including end users like all of us. We are promoting laws to fight cyber-crime and building capacity in the developing world so that they have the ability to deal with these online threats. We are putting countries on notice when their conduct in cyberspace is unacceptable and also building coalitions to make sure that they’re accountable. And we are championing a framework of international cyber stability so countries know that there are some basic rules of the world that governs their actions in cyberspace and that we have ways to make sure when incidents occur that we can solve them and de-escalate them. In short, we’re really doing what diplomats have always done. We are building bridges. We’re building alliances. We’re bridging gaps. We’re promoting international understandings and agreements, all to make us safer. This is a big job, and to be frank, our journey has just started. There wasn’t anything even called cyber diplomacy just a couple of years ago. And the stakes are very high. I was at a – one of these big cyber conferences a couple of years ago and they had a separate youth forum, and at the end of the conference, the spokes-kid for the youth forum came out and he addressed the main conference. And he said, “I don’t know why all you old guys keep going on about cyberspace.” I mean, it’s – to them, cyberspace is just part of their everyday lives and existence. They don’t see any distinction. Now, for many of us, I don’t think that’s true as of yet, but as we have things like the internet of things and connected homes and everything we do is linked to the web, I think it’s clear that decisions we made about – make about the online world have profound implications for the physical one. Will we have a global communications platform that is open and where information can move, or will we have a fragmented one where countries draw lines and borders around their individual country’s cyber space? Will we have – will we be safe and secure in our online lives, or will it be the dystopian province of criminals and other disruptors? Will we have – will cyber-space be a military free-fire zone or will we work together to build international cyber stability? As – a big part of the answer to all those questions and many others is our efforts to engage the rest of the world through diplomacy to shape the future that we want. To go back to where I started, to the movie Colossus, we don’t need computers to rule the world for us all to survive. But we do need the people who use technology to empower us and not to attack us or control us. We need to have a cyberspace that is open, that is interoperable, that is reliable and secure altogether, not just for us but for everyone in the world and everyplace in the world so they can realize the benefits. That’s my mission as a cyber diplomat. That’s the mission I hope we can all share. And that’s an idea that needs spreading. Thank you very much.

TITLE: Briefing on the State Department Inspector General's Report, Office of the Secretary: Evaluation of Email Records Management and Cybersecurity Requirements

TEXT: MODERATOR: Thank you, and thanks to everyone for joining us on such relatively short notice. Well, we all know why we’re here. The Office of the Inspector General’s Report on the Evaluation of Email Records Management and Cybersecurity Requirements, which is scheduled to be released publicly tomorrow, has, in true Washington fashion, been released to some of you a little bit early. And so we felt it would be useful to pull together a call on background with two senior State Department officials to walk through some of the report’s findings as well as recommendations, and also to try to answer some of your questions, for those of you who have read through the report already. So for your edification, the two senior State Department officials that we have with us today are [names and titles withheld]. Now, they will henceforth be known as Senior State Department Official One and Senior State Department Official Two. And again, this is a call that is on background, and also, we would like it to be embargoed until the end of the call. So without further ado, I’ll hand it over to Senior State Department Official Number One. SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE: Thank you, [Moderator], and good afternoon to everyone. I wanted to just make some general points about this inspection report. First of all, Secretary Kerry asked our inspector general to undertake this review back in March of 2015, when he basically asked the IG to look at our records preservation and transparency systems. And we’re already working to implement numerous improvements to both our email and records management systems. Many of these improvements were underway even before the IG report came out. And I would also note that the State Department has accepted all eight of the recommendations in the report, and the OIG has basically said that the eight recommendations have been resolved, which means that they agree with our plans to address the different recommendations. I would also like to highlight that – as stated very early on in the report – that many of the challenges that are highlighted in the review are actually common across all federal agencies. This is a time of great transition for all of us as we move from a decades-old, paper-based recordkeeping system to be able to keep up with our recordkeeping in this new electronic age that we find ourselves. And so while it is – we do face some challenges here at the State Department, other agencies are struggling with some of these same issues. I think it’s clear from the report that the Department could have done a better job preserving emails and records of secretaries of state and their senior staff going back several administrations. And we also acknowledge the report’s finding that compliance with email and records management guidance has been inconsistent across several administrations. That being said, as a result of concerted efforts going all the way back to late 2014, 2015, I think that the Department is much better situated today than during the historical periods that are described in this report. Certainly, by early 2015, we had taken a number of steps, and let me outline just a few of those. By early 2015, we had received former Secretary Clinton’s emails that she provided us – 55,000 pages. And in 2015 and 2016, we worked very, very hard to release those emails. They are now available to the public. Other steps that we took: We have undertaken a program within the Department that has been approved by the National Archives and Records Administration to basically archive all of the email of certain senior officials. That is ongoing. We also are in the process of selecting new technology which is going to help us meet the deadlines that have been set both by the White House and the National Archives for managing our records electronically. We hope to have that new technology in place by the end of this calendar year, and it is going to greatly enhance our records-keeping abilities; also our FOIA capability. So we’re really looking forward to that. We have set up a permanent steering committee, if you will – an electronic records management working group that has been meeting since 2013 to look at policies and practices within the Department to make sure that we are moving ahead and progressing towards a more modern system. And in the past two years we’ve also increased the communication within the State Department with employees about their responsibilities for recordkeeping, and the Secretary himself issued a notice on the importance of FOIA not too long ago. So this has high-level attention and it has ongoing efforts here in the State Department to address these many challenges that we face. MODERATOR: Great. We’ll just send it over to Senior State Department Official Number Two to make some comments and then we’ll hand it over – or we’ll take some of your questions, rather. SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO: Thanks, [Moderator], and good afternoon to everybody. I just want to pick up on where we left off there, which is one of the key findings that we see in the OIG’s report is that while the Department has had policies going back over several administrations, we have not done a great job of ensuring that people understand them or have the tools to follow them in a straightforward and administrable way. One of the best examples of that is that print and filing emails continues to be the way that most Department employees are supposed to archive their emails. We are hoping to move past that system this year, but that is still pending. So one of the issues is that while we are doing better, we’re still not where we want to be and we need to do better. And then the final thing I wanted to flag is that while the OIG report provides a clear-eyed assessment that we have not lived up to all of our obligations in the past – and that has caused problems – we’ve taken significant steps not only to improve our systems today, but a lot of the past problems have been mitigated by getting emails back, by putting them on the internet and adopting new technology. So we’re looking forward to building on the OIG report. We’re building on the work that our transparency coordinator is doing and moving forward.

TITLE: International Cybersecurity Strategy: Deterring Foreign Threats and Building Global Cyber Norms

TEXT: Chairman Gardner, Ranking Member Cardin, members of the Subcommittee on East Asia, the Pacific, and International Cybersecurity Policy, it is a pleasure to appear again before your Subcommittee to provide an update on key developments in our cyber foreign policy efforts. Since I testified before your Subcommittee one year ago, the Department of State (the Department) has continued to work closely with other Federal departments and agencies and has made significant progress in a number of areas. It is also important to note that last month, as required by the Consolidated Appropriations Act for 2016, the Department submitted to Congress the Department of State International Cyberspace Policy Strategy (the Strategy) that included a report on the Department’s work to implement the President’s 2011 International Strategy for Cyberspace, as well as a discussion of our efforts to promote norms of responsible state behavior in cyberspace, alternative concepts for norms promoted by certain other countries, threats facing the United States, tools available to the President to deter malicious actors, and resources required to build international norms. I appreciate the opportunity today to provide an update on our progress as well as the challenges we face in a number of areas. As reflected in the Strategy we provided to Congress last month, the Department of State structures its cyberspace diplomacy in close cooperation with our interagency partners – including the Departments of Justice, Commerce, Defense, Homeland Security, and Treasury, and the Intelligence Community – around the following interrelated, dynamic, and cross-cutting policy pillars drawn from the President’s International Strategy for Cyberspace: digital economy; international security; promoting cybersecurity due diligence; combating cybercrime; Internet governance; Internet freedom; and international development and capacity building, as well as cross-cutting issues such as countering the use of the Internet for terrorist purposes. In addition, as we noted, the Department actively is mainstreaming cyberspace issues into its foreign diplomatic engagements and building the necessary internal capacity. I am happy to answer any questions regarding the Strategy, which discusses all of these policy priorities in greater detail, including specific accomplishments from our robust bilateral and multilateral diplomatic engagements and highlights from the roles and contributions of other Federal agencies. In spite of the successes outlined in the Strategy, the U.S. vision for an open, interoperable, secure, and reliable Internet faces a range of policy and technical challenges. Many of these challenges were described in my testimony last year, and they largely remain. I would like to focus my time today delving specifically into our efforts to promote a broad international framework for cyber stability, as well some of the alternative views regarding the Internet that some governments are promoting. I will also spend some time discussing the technical challenges and threats posed by continuing malicious cyber activity directed at the United States, as well as our allies, and the tools we have at our disposal to deter these actions. Diplomatic Efforts to Shape the Policy Environment. Building a Framework for International Stability in Cyberspace. The Department of State, working with our interagency partners, is guided by the vision of the President’s International Strategy for Cyberspace, which is to promote a strategic framework of international cyber stability designed to achieve and maintain a peaceful cyberspace environment where all states are able to fully realize its benefits, where there are advantages to cooperating against common threats and avoiding conflict, and where there is little incentive for states to engage in disruptive behavior or to attack one another. This framework has three key elements: (1) global affirmation that international law applies to state behavior in cyberspace; (2) development of an international consensus on and promotion of additional voluntary norms of responsible state behavior in cyberspace that apply during peacetime; and (3) development and implementation of practical confidence building measures (CBMs), which promote stability in cyberspace by reducing the risks of misperception and escalation. Since 2009, the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security (UN GGE) has served as a productive and groundbreaking expert-level venue for the United States to build support for this framework. The consensus recommendations of the three UN GGE reports in 2010, 2013, and 2015 have set the standard for the international community on international cyberspace norms and CBMs. The UN GGE process will continue to play a central role in our efforts to fully promulgate this framework when it reconvenes in August 2016. Applicability of international law. The first and most fundamental pillar of our framework for international cyber stability is the applicability of existing international law to state behavior in cyberspace. The 2013 UN GGE report was a landmark achievement that affirmed the applicability of existing international law, including the UN Charter, to state conduct in cyberspace. The 2013 report underscored that states must act in cyberspace under the established international obligations and commitments that have guided their actions for decades – in peacetime and during conflict – and states must meet their international obligations regarding internationally wrongful acts attributable to them. The 2014-2015 UN GGE also made progress on issues related to international law by affirming the applicability of the inherent right to self-defense as recognized in Article 51 of the UN Charter, and noting the law of armed conflict’s fundamental principles of humanity, necessity, proportionality, and distinction. Norms of responsible state behavior. The United States is also building consensus on a set of additional, voluntary norms of responsible state behavior in cyberspace that define key areas of risk that would be of national and/or economic security concern to all states and which should be off-limits during times of peace. If observed, these stability measures – which are measures of self-restraint – can contribute substantially to conflict prevention and stability. The United States was the first state to propose a set of specific peacetime cyber norms, including the cybersecurity of critical infrastructure, the protection of computer security incident response teams (CSIRTs), and cooperation between states in responding to appropriate requests in mitigating malicious cyber activity emanating from their territory. In May 2015, Secretary of State Kerry highlighted these norms in his speech in Seoul, South Korea, on an open and secure Internet. The 2015 UN GGE report’s most significant achievement was its recommendation for voluntary norms of state behavior designed for peacetime, which included concepts championed by the United States. Confidence Building Measures. Together with our work on law and voluntary norms, cyber CBMs have the potential to contribute substantially to international cyber stability. CBMs have been used for decades to build confidence, reduce risk, and increase transparency in other areas of international concern. Examples of cyber CBMs include: transparency measures, such as sharing national strategies or doctrine; cooperative measures, such as an initiative to combat a particular cyber incident or threat actor; and stability measures, such as committing to refrain from a certain activity of concern. Cyber CBMs are being developed, and are in the first stages of implementation, in two regional venues – the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the ASEAN Regional Forum where agreement was reached in 2015 on a detailed work plan with a proposed set of CBMs for future implementation. Although many of the elements of the framework I have described above may seem self-evident to an American audience, it is important to recognize that cyber issues are new to many states, and as I describe later in my testimony, there are also many states that hold alternative views on how we should promote cyber stability. Notwithstanding these headwinds, as well as the fact that diplomatic negotiations on other issues can take many years, if not decades, the United States and its allies have made substantial progress in recent years towards advancing our strategic framework of international cyber stability. At this point, I would like to highlight examples from last year that reflect our progress. U.S.-China Cyber Commitments. The United States strongly opposes the use of cyber technology to steal intellectual property for commercial advantage, and has raised this concern with Chinese interlocutors for several years. In 2014, the U.S. indicted five members of the Chinese military for hacking, economic espionage, and other offenses directed at six U.S. entities. This led China to suspend the U.S.-China Cyber Working Group. The U.S. and China, however, reached agreement during President Xi Jinping’s state visit in September 2015 on several key commitments on cyber issues. These commitments are: (1) both governments agreed to cooperate and provide timely responses to requests for information and assistance regarding malicious cyber activity emanating from their territories; (2) neither country’s government will conduct or knowingly support cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property for commercial advantage; (3) both governments will work together to further identify and promote appropriate norms of state behavior in cyberspace and hold a senior experts group on international security issues in cyberspace; and (4) both governments will establish a Ministerial-level joint dialogue mechanism on fighting cybercrime and related issues. Two weeks ago today – on May 11 – the United States hosted the first meeting of the senior experts group in Washington on international security issues in cyberspace, which provided a forum to further engage China on its views and seek common ground regarding norms of state behavior in cyberspace and other topics. The Department of State led the U.S. delegation that included participation from the Department of Defense and other U.S. government agencies. The senior experts group helps us advance the growing international consensus on international law and voluntary cyber norms of state behavior. We also have encouraged China to join us in pushing for other states to affirm these principles in international forums like the Group of Twenty (G20), and will continue to do so. To implement other commitments reached during President Xi’s visit, the United States and China held the first ministerial level dialogue on cybercrime and other related issues in Washington on December 1, 2015. Attorney General Loretta Lynch and Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, together with Chinese State Councilor Guo Shengkun, co-chaired the first U.S.-China High-Level Joint Dialogue on Cybercrime and Related Issues to foster mutual understanding and enhance cooperation on law enforcement and network protection issues. The second dialogue is scheduled to occur next month in Beijing, China. Moreover, regarding the commitment that neither government will conduct or knowingly support cyber-enabled theft for commercial gain, Deputy Secretary of State Blinken testified last month before the full Committee on Foreign Relations that the United States is “watching very closely to ensure this commitment is followed by action.” The outcomes of last year’s Xi-Obama summit focus on concrete actions and arrangements that will allow us to hold Beijing accountable to the commitments they have made. These commitments do not resolve all our challenges with China on cyber issues. However, they do represent a step forward in our efforts to address one of the sharpest areas of disagreement in the U.S.-China bilateral relationship. Group of Twenty (G20) Antalya Summit. In November 2015, the leaders of the G20 met in Antalya, Turkey, to discuss and make progress on a wide range of critical issues facing the global economy. At the conclusion of the Antalya Summit, the strong final communique issued by the G20 leaders affirmed the U.S.-championed vision of international cyber stability and its pillars. Among other things, the G20 leaders affirmed in their statement that “no country should conduct or support the ICT-enabled theft of intellectual property, including trade secrets or other confidential business information, with the intent of providing competitive advantages to companies or commercial sectors.” They also highlighted the “key role played by the United Nations in developing norms” and the work of the UN GGE and its 2015 report. Addressing our overall framework, the G20 leaders stated that they “affirm that international law, and in particular the UN Charter, is applicable to state conduct in the use of ICTs and commit ourselves to the view that all states should abide by norms of responsible state behavior in the use of ICTs… .” The G20 leaders’ communique represents a remarkable endorsement of our approach to promoting stability in cyberspace. But there is still more to do. The United States will continue to work within the G20 and in other bilateral and multilateral engagements to promote and expand these policy pronouncements regarding responsible state behavior in cyberspace. Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. As a result of the leadership by the United States and like-minded countries, the 57 member states of the OSCE, which includes not only Western allies but also Russia and other former Soviet states, reached consensus in March 2016 on an expanded set of CBMs. This expanded set, which includes five new CBMs, builds upon the 11 CBMs announced by the OSCE in 2013 that member states are already working to implement. The initial 11 CBMs were primarily focused on building transparency and putting in place mechanisms for de-escalating conflict. For example, there were CBMs calling upon participating states to identify points of contact that foreign governments could reach out to in the event of a cyber incident emanating from the state’s territory and put in place consultation and mediation mechanisms. The additional five CBMs focused more on cooperative measures focusing on issues like cybersecurity of critical infrastructure and developing public-private partnerships. Secure and resilient critical infrastructure, including in the communications sector, requires the integration of cyber, physical, and human elements. Since most critical infrastructure is privately owned, public-private partnerships are essential for strengthening critical infrastructure. Given the distributed nature of critical infrastructure, these efforts also require international collaboration. Work will continue this year to strengthen implementation of the previous CBMs and to begin implementing the new ones as well. This will build on the cooperation we have underway with many international partners in this and other similar fora. We also hope that this further success within the OSCE context can serve to strengthen CBMs as a model that other regional security organizations can adopt. In addition to our work with governmental organizations, the Department of State engages extensively with a range of stakeholders outside of government, who play critical roles in helping to preserve and promote the same vision of cyberspace held by the United States. Non-government stakeholders are often part of our delegations to key meetings, for which there is intensive consultation, and we often engage with our stakeholders before and after key events to hear their views and to inform them of our activities. We also engage extensively with the stakeholder community ahead of and immediately following major cyber conferences, such as the Global Conference on Cyberspace, most recently in The Hague, the Netherlands, and previously in Seoul, South Korea. Policy Challenge: Alternative Views of the Internet. A challenge to the implementation of our cyberspace strategy is a competing and alternative view of the Internet. The United States and much of the broader international community support the open flow and movement of data on the Internet that drives economic growth, protects human rights, and promotes innovation. The United States believes in a multistakeholder approach whereby governments, private sector, civil society, and the technical and academic communities cooperate to address both technical and policy threats through inclusive, transparent, consensus-driven processes. China’s approach to cyberspace in the international context is propelled by its desire to maintain internal stability, maintain sovereignty over its domestic cyberspace, and combat what it argues is an emerging cyber arms race and ‘militarization’ of cyberspace. China has been willing to consider cyber confidence building measures, and has affirmed that international law applies in cyberspace, but has not been willing to affirm more specifically the applicability of the law of armed conflict or other laws of war, because it believes it would only serve to legitimize state use of cyber tools as weapons of war. This has led to a set of external policies that reinforces traditional Chinese foreign policy priorities of non-interference in internal affairs, national sovereignty over cyberspace, and “no first use” of weapons. China views its expansive online censorship regime – including technologies such as the Great Firewall – as a necessary defense against destabilizing domestic and foreign influences, and it has promoted this conception internationally. China also urges creation of new “cyber governance” instruments, which would, inter alia, create new binding rules designed to limit the development, deployment, and use of “information weapons,” promote speech and content controls, seek to replace the framework of the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime (Budapest Convention), elevate the role of governments vis-à-vis other stakeholders, and likely give the United Nations authority for determining attribution and responding to malicious cyber activity. While the United States and its partners seek to focus our cyber policy efforts on combatting threats to networks, cyber infrastructure, and other physical threats from cyber tools, China also emphasizes the threats posed by online content. In addition, some of these policies stand in sharp contrast to the U.S. view that all stakeholders should be able to contribute to the making of public policy regarding the Internet. Russia’s approach to cyberspace in the international context has focused on the maintenance of internal stability, as well as sovereignty over its “information space.” While Russia co-authored the Code of Conduct, with China and other Shanghai Cooperation Organization members, Russia’s ultimate goal is also a new international cyber convention, which they pair with criticism of the Budapest Convention. Russia has nonetheless found common ground with the United States on our approach of promoting the applicability of international law to state conduct in cyberspace as well as voluntary, non-binding norms of state behavior in peacetime. Russia has also committed to the first ever set of bilateral cyber confidence building measures with the United States, as well as the first ever set of cyber CBMs within a multilateral institution, at the OSCE in 2013 and 2016 that I previously discussed. We counter these alternative concepts of cyberspace policy through a range of diplomatic tools that include not only engagement in multilateral venues, but also direct bilateral engagement and awareness-raising with a variety of state and non-state actors. I now would like to discuss some of the technical challenges and threats the U.S. faces and some of the tools we have to respond to and prevent cyber incidents. Responding to and Preventing Cyber Incidents. Continuing Cyber Threats. Cyber threats to U.S. national and economic security are increasing in frequency, scale, sophistication, and severity. In 2015, high profile cyber incidents included the breach of health insurance company Anthem, Inc.’s IT system that resulted in the theft of account information for millions of customers; an unauthorized breach of the Office of Personnel Management’s systems that resulted in the theft of approximately 22 million personnel files; and hackers launching an unprecedented attack on the Ukraine power grid that cut power to hundreds of thousands of customers. Overall, the unclassified information and communications technology networks that support U.S. government, military, commercial, and social activities remain vulnerable to espionage and disruption. As the Department noted in the Strategy we submitted last month, however, the likelihood of a catastrophic attack against the United States from any particular actor is remote at this time. The Intelligence Community instead foresees an ongoing series of low-to-moderate level cyber operations from a variety of sources, which will impose cumulative costs on U.S. economic competitiveness and national security, pose risks to Federal and private sector infrastructure in the United States, infringe upon the rights of U.S. intellectual property holders, and violate the privacy of U.S. citizens. In February, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper testified before Congress on the 2016 Worldwide Threat Assessment of the US Intelligence Community, and stated: “Many actors remain undeterred from conducting reconnaissance, espionage, and even attacks in cyberspace because of the relatively low costs of entry, the perceived payoff, and the lack of significant consequences.” He highlighted the malicious cyber activities of the leading state actors, non-state actors such as Da'esh, and criminals who are developing and using sophisticated cyber tools, including ransomware for extortion and malware to target government networks. The Intelligence Community continues to witness an increase in the scale and scope of reporting on malicious cyber activity that can be measured by the amount of corporate data stolen or deleted, personally identifiable information compromised, or remediation costs incurred by U.S. victims. The motivation to conduct cyber attacks and cyber espionage will probably remain strong because of the gains for the perpetrators. Tools Available to Counter Cyber Threats. The United States works to counter technical challenges through a whole-of-government approach that brings to bear its full range of instruments of national power and corresponding policy tools – diplomatic, law enforcement, economic, military, and intelligence – as appropriate and consistent with applicable law. The United States believes that deterrence in cyberspace is best accomplished through a combination of “deterrence by denial” – reducing the incentive of potential adversaries to use cyber capabilities against the United States by persuading them that the United States can deny their objectives – and “deterrence through cost imposition” – threatening or carrying out actions to inflict penalties and costs against adversaries that conduct malicious cyber activity against the United States. It is important to note that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to deterring or responding to cyber threats. Rather, the individual characteristics of a particular threat determine the tools that would most appropriately be used. The President has at his disposal a number of tools to carry out deterrence by denial. These include a range of policies, regulations, and voluntary standards aimed at increasing the security and resiliency of U.S. government and private sector computer systems. They also include incident response capabilities and certain law enforcement authorities. With respect to cost imposition, the President is able to draw on a range of response options from across the United States government. Diplomatic tools provide a way to communicate to adversaries when their actions are unacceptable and to build support and greater cooperation among, or seek assistance from, allies and like-minded countries to address shared threats. Diplomatic démarches to both friendly and potentially hostile states have become a regular component of the United States’ response to major international cyber incidents. In the longer term, U.S. efforts to promote principles of responsible state behavior in cyberspace, including peacetime norms, are intended to build increasing consensus among like-minded states that can form a basis for cooperative responses to irresponsible state actions. Law enforcement tools can be used to investigate crimes and prosecute malicious cyber actors both within the United States and abroad. International cooperation is critical to cybercrime investigations, which is why the United States has promoted international harmonization of substantive and procedural cybercrime laws through the Budapest Convention, created an informal channel for data preservation and information sharing through the G7 24/7 network, and promoted donor partnerships to assist developing nations. Economic tools, such as financial sanctions, may be used as a part of the broader U.S. strategy to change, constrain, and stigmatize the behavior of malicious actors in cyberspace. Since January 2015, the President has provided guidance to the Secretary of the Treasury to impose sanctions to counter North Korea’s malicious cyber-enabled activities. Executive Order 13687 was issued, in part, in response to the provocative and destructive attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment, while Executive Order 13722 targets, among others, significant activities by North Korea to undermine cybersecurity, in line with the recently-signed North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act of 2016. Aside from these North Korea-specific authorities, in April 2015, the President issued Executive Order 13694, Blocking the Property of Certain Persons Engaging in Significant Malicious Cyber-Enabled Activities, which authorizes the imposition of sanctions against persons whose malicious cyber-enabled activities could pose a significant threat to the national security, foreign policy, or economic health or financial stability of the United States. Military capabilities provide an important set of options for deterring and responding to malicious cyber activity. The Department of Defense continues to build its cyber capabilities and strengthen its cyber defense and deterrence posture. As part of this effort, the Department of Defense is building its Cyber Mission Force, which is already employing its capabilities to defend Department of Defense networks, defend the Nation against cyberattacks of significant consequence, and generate integrated cyberspace effects in support of operational plans and contingency operations. In addition, Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter announced earlier this year that U.S. forces are using cyber tools to disrupt Da'esh’s command and control systems and to negatively impact its networks. Intelligence capabilities are also an important tool at the President’s disposal in detecting, responding to, and deterring malicious activities in cyberspace, particularly given the unique challenges associated with attributing and understanding the motivation behind such malicious activities. Even with this broad range of tools, deterring cyber threats remains a challenge. Given the unique characteristics of cyberspace, the United States continues to work to develop additional and appropriate consequences that it can impose on malicious cyber actors. Capacity Building. In addition to the tools that I have just outlined, the ability of the United States to respond to foreign cyber threats and fight transnational cybercrime is greatly enhanced by the capabilities and strength of our international partners in this area. Therefore, the Department of State is working with departments and agencies, allies and multilateral partners to build the capacity of foreign governments, particularly in developing countries, to secure their own networks as well as investigate and prosecute cybercriminals within their borders. The Department also actively promotes donor cooperation, including bilateral and multilateral participation in joint cyber capacity building initiatives. In 2015, for example, the United States joined the Netherlands in founding the Global Forum on Cyber Expertise, a global platform for countries, international organizations, and the private sector to exchange best practices and expertise on cyber capacity building. The United States partnered with Japan, Australia, Canada, the African Union Commission, and Symantec on four cybersecurity and cybercrime capacity building initiatives. The Department also provided assistance to the Council of Europe, the Organization of American States, and the United Nations Global Program on Cybercrime to enable delivery of capacity building assistance to developing nations. Many traditional bilateral law enforcement training programs increasingly include cyber elements, such as training investigators and prosecutors in the handling of electronic evidence. Much of our foreign law enforcement training on combating intellectual property crime focuses on digital theft. In another example of capacity building, the Department of State, through its Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, manages five International Law Enforcement Academies (ILEAs) worldwide, and one additional Regional Training Center. These six facilities provide law enforcement training and instruction to law enforcement officials from approximately 85 countries each year. The ILEA program includes a wide variety of cyber investigation training courses, from basic to advanced levels, taught by subject matter experts from the U.S. Secret Service and other agencies and policy-level discussions with senior criminal justice officials. This serves as a force multiplier to enhance the capabilities of the international law enforcement community to collaborate in the effort to fight cybercrime. The Department of State is committed to continuing its capacity building initiatives as another effective way to counter international cyber threats and promote international cyber stability. Looking ahead. Cybersecurity will continue to be a challenge for the United States when we take into consideration the rapidly expanding environment of global cyber threats, the increasing reliance on information technology and number of “smart devices,” the reality that many developing nations are still in the early stages of their cyber maturity, and the ongoing and increasingly sophisticated use of information technology by terrorists and other criminals. Thus, the Department of State anticipates a continued increase and expansion of our cyber-focused diplomatic and capacity building efforts for the foreseeable future. The Department will continue to spearhead the effort to promote international consensus that existing international law applies to state actions in cyberspace and build support for certain peacetime norms through assisting states in developing technical capabilities and relevant laws and policies, to ensure they are able to properly meet their commitments on norms of international cyber behavior. The Department of State remains appreciative of this Subcommittee’s continued support. Thank you for the opportunity to testify today. I am happy to answer your questions.

TITLE: Remarks by Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch at RSA Conference on Cybersecurity

TEXT: Good afternoon, and thank you for that warm welcome. I want to thank the organizers of this conference for making this important gathering possible. It is a pleasure and a privilege to share this room with so many innovative professionals and knowledgeable security specialists.  I am excited to have the opportunity to speak with you today.  Twenty-five years ago – long before words like “smartphone” and “WiFi” became part of our everyday vocabulary – the RSA Conference was founded on the belief that technological innovation presents not only extraordinary opportunities, but also unprecedented challenges – and that overcoming those challenges would require bold thinking and close cooperation.  In the quarter century since that inaugural meeting, the RSA Conference has played a key role in spurring groundbreaking conversations, catalyzing new ideas, and forging the lasting partnerships that ensure our capacity for developing technology is matched by our ability to protect it. Of course, as long as humans have shared information with one another, other humans have sought to block, steal, and tamper with that data.  But information – and the technology that stores and transports it – has never been more important to our society, and so the task of securing it has never been more urgent, or more challenging.  Today, we rely on digital technology for functions as routine as watching movies and buying groceries, and as consequential as distributing electricity and directing our military – and in the years to come, our use of this technology will only grow and develop further.  We are in the midst of an exciting and revolutionary transformation that is undoubtedly making our lives more convenient and our society more efficient.  But it has also opened new avenues for a variety of wrongdoers, from thieves and hackers to terrorists, other violent extremists, and state-sponsored actors. These criminals rely on virtual methods to inflict material damage – and as several high-profile incidents have reminded us in recent years, online adversaries pose significant threats to our personal privacy, our economic property, and even our national security. As the cabinet agency entrusted with the enforcement of America’s laws, the protection of the American people, and the defense of American ideals, the Department of Justice has a special responsibility to address these threats, and we’re working on a number of fronts to meet the law enforcement challenges of the 21st century.  We have used a host of tools, including criminal prosecution, sanctions, designations, and diplomatic options. The FBI’s Cyber Division investigates and monitors digital intrusions and security risks around the clock, and each of its 56 field offices operates a Cyber Task Force to help bolster our resilience at the state and local levels.  The bureau also leads the 19-agency National Cyber Investigative Joint Task Force, which President Obama established in 2009 to coordinate the government’s response to online dangers. Each of the 93 United States Attorneys – from every state and territory – prosecutes cyber crimes and interfaces with corporations and public assets on cybersecurity and preventing cyber intrusions.  Our Criminal Division recently formed a cybersecurity unit staffed by experienced prosecutors knowledgeable in the law, policy, and practice of cybercrime prevention.  The National Security Division has created the nation-wide NSCS Network, which consists of over 100 specially trained federal prosecutors in every jurisdiction, who combat online threats to our national security. And our Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives has created an Internet Investigations Center where federal agents and lawyers work to counter illegal online firearms trafficking. These are just a few of the ways that we’re investigating and disrupting a wide range of cybercrimes and threats.  But the Internet doesn’t stop at the water’s edge; it crosses borders and transcends boundaries, which is why we are committed to working closely with our partners overseas to promote global cybersecurity.  One of our most invaluable allies in that effort is the European Cybercrime Center, or EC3 – the European Union’s central cybercrime coordinating body.  In November 2014, we joined with EC3 to launch Operation Onymous, which shuttered a number of so-called “dark market websites” peddling drugs, weapons, stolen credit card data, fake passports, and computer-hacking tools.  This past July, we joined with EC3 to shut down the Darkode hacking forum – an underground site where hackers bought, sold, and traded malicious software, botnets, intrusion tools, and stolen personal information. That operation, spearheaded by the U.S. Department of Justice and EC3, involved a coalition of 20 nations, and led to the charge, arrest, or search of 70 Darkode members and associates around the world. We continue to work with EC3 and other international organizations to root out dangerous hackers, data thieves, and other malicious actors who seek to breach secure spaces of the Internet for their own destructive purposes. Beyond our focus on specific cases, we’re also working to adapt international criminal justice processes to function more efficiently and effectively in the digital age.  Recently, for example, we have been working to find ways to streamline the way we and our allies can access electronic evidence across borders. When our allies investigate criminal activities abroad, they increasingly require access to electronic evidence from American companies that are providing internet communications services to their citizens and residents. Our companies may face conflicting legal obligations when those governments require them to disclose electronic information that U.S. law prevents them from disclosing. In addition to harming our allies’ efforts to investigate terrorism and other serious crimes, this puts our companies in a difficult position: either they comply with a foreign order, and risk a violation of American law – or they refuse to comply, and risk a violation of foreign law.  We have given a great deal of thought to how we can alleviate these burdens, advance public safety, and protect privacy and civil liberties. Today, I am pleased to report that we have begun negotiations with the United Kingdom to establish a new framework that would permit UK authorities to access electronic communications directly from American companies where the investigation targets accounts not used by Americans or people in the United States. To qualify, the UK government would have to agree to a number of provisions designed to protect privacy and fundamental rights, and a UK order would have to comply with UK law.  This agreement would release American companies from conflicting legal obligations in clearly and carefully defined circumstances.  It would help one of our oldest and closest allies perform high-priority criminal investigations that keep its citizens safe – and many of which, in our age of transnational crime and terrorism, also further American interests.  It would provide reciprocal benefits for U.S. government requests to UK companies, which could help U.S. investigations in the years ahead.  And, if it proves successful, it could be replicated with other countries, if – and only if – their laws adequately protect privacy and civil liberties, potentially encouraging other nations to improve their laws and enhance privacy protections in order to obtain the benefits of this arrangement. This new framework would require action from Congress in order to take effect, and we will continue to engage with communications companies, civil society groups, and academics as we move forward.  But based on our conversations and collaboration so far, I am hopeful that we can take an important step forward that benefits security, commerce, international cooperation, and privacy. Of course, our partnerships are not limited to government agencies. In addition to standing alongside our global counterparts, we’re committed to working closely with the private sector – particularly tech leaders right here at home.  Even over the last few years, we’ve used those partnerships to protect information systems and address cyber threats. From our groundbreaking Coreflood operation – in which we were able to free hundreds of thousands of computers from criminal control with the help of private experts and additional network security companies – to our takedown of the infamous financial botnet known as GameOver Zeus, we have consistently worked side-by-side with private-sector security experts like the people in this room to halt technologically sophisticated crimes and bring perpetrators to justice.  We have also created new channels for information sharing and cooperation with the private sector to help us detect, deter, and disrupt cyber threats. Cases like the Sony intrusion, in which we publicly named – for the first time – the nation-state responsible for a destructive attack on an American company – demonstrate the power of reporting. The Justice Department’s relationships in this area form an important part of our ability to do our best work.  There is no doubt that America’s technology sector represents one of the greatest repositories of ingenuity and innovation in history, and those of us responsible for protecting the American people in a time of increasingly sophisticated threats would be remiss if we did not seek the assistance of experts like the ones gathered in this room.  That’s why we’re reaching out and collaborating with you and your companies in a number of ways, including through the FBI’s InfraGard partnership; the National Cyber Investigative Joint Task Force’s regular consultations with the private sector; and my own frequent meetings with industry leaders to identify emerging threats, and, whenever possible, to devise productive solutions to pressing issues. In fact, just last week, the Department of Justice hosted a group of experts from some of America’s foremost tech companies for a discussion about how we can work together to more effectively counter violent extremism.  That conversation followed a number of other gatherings that examined ways to deny criminals and terrorists the safe harbors they seek in the recesses of the Internet and hidden corners of our networks.  As you know, the Going Dark problem is a very real threat to law enforcement’s mission to protect public safety and ensure that criminals are caught and held accountable.  We owe it to victims and to the public whose safety we must protect to ensure we have done everything under the law to fully investigate terrorist attacks and criminal activity on American soil. That is a goal that I know we all share. I know that neither our technology companies nor their leaders have any sympathy for the terrorists or criminals who target Americans. And the Department of Justice will never sacrifice the safety of the American people or the ideals that we all cherish. As recent events have made clear, the stakes aren’t theoretical; they bear directly upon our public safety and our national security. That’s why conversations like this one are so important: they help us “connect to protect” American infrastructure, American networks, American values, and American lives. I want you to know how much I appreciate your support in that endeavor, and I look forward to continuing a frank dialogue and a fruitful partnership with this industry in the months ahead. Of course, we won’t always find ourselves on the same side of every issue – after all, the challenges raised by modern technology are complex, and I have no illusions that they will soon become any simpler.  As we venture further into the digital age, the questions we grapple with will only become more difficult, more intricate, and more intertwined.  In order to surmount the obstacles we will surely encounter, we don’t necessarily have to be locked in perpetual and perfect agreement – but we do have to be engaged in open dialogue, so that we can draw upon each other’s resources, hear each other’s concerns, and learn from each other’s perspectives. That’s how we spur new ideas, forge better solutions, and find the way forward. That’s how we strengthen our defenses, prevent damaging crimes, and bring wrongdoers to justice. And that’s how we move closer to our shared goal of ensuring that as the American people reap the benefits of innovation, they continue to enjoy the full protection of the law. That goal will remain one of my top priorities as long as I am Attorney General, and I will continue to rely on your vision, your commitment, and your cooperation in the months ahead.  I am confident that together, we can achieve a future that is brighter, safer, and more prosperous for every American. Thank you.

TITLE: Inter-American Committee Against Terrorism (CICTE): Sixteenth Regular Session

TEXT: Background: The Sixteenth Regular Session of the Inter-American Committee Against Terrorism (CICTE) will focus on three themes that Chile, the incoming CICTE Chair, selected: 1) Use of the Internet for Terrorist and Criminal Purposes; 2) Cybersecurity: Critical Considerations for the Development of the Economy and a Digital Society; and 3) Confidence Building Measures in Cyberspace. In 2015, the CICTE Secretariat conducted 62 activities, training courses, and technical assistance missions that benefited more than 3687 participants in five thematic areas including cybersecurity. The United States is a major contributor to CICTE’s training programs and has provided funding and expert trainers for capacity building programs focused on aviation security, travel document security and fraud prevention, cybersecurity, legislative assistance and counterterrorism financing, supply chain security, and Customs and Immigration. Remarks/Notes: I would like to begin by thanking the Organization of American States (OAS) and the Inter-American Committee Against Terrorism (CICTE) for organizing this meeting and for your continued recognition of the importance of cyber policy, particularly cybersecurity as a top priority for our region. We are all increasingly dependent on networked information systems for the daily functioning of our societies. With that dependency has come increasing concern about new and existing vulnerabilities, the exploitation of which can make individuals targets of criminal actors operating on the Internet, and can now affect whole populations through threats to cyber- enabled infrastructures. We all face increasing risks from state and non-state actors that conduct malicious cyber activity for unacceptable ends, including stealing trade secrets or personal information for commercial or financial gain, interfering with the exercise of freedom of expression, and intentionally damaging or even destroying critical infrastructure. These threats can range from everyday email spam, to serious transnational criminal behavior, to activity that could constitute a threat to national security. As the U.S. Director of National Intelligence recently noted, the “likelihood of a catastrophic attack from any particular actor is remote at this time,” we are likely to see “an ongoing series of low-to-moderate level cyber attacks from a variety of sources” that will, over time, “impose costs on U.S. economic competitiveness and national security.” Given the global, interconnected nature of cyberspace and infrastructure, these threats and potential costs are not unique to the United States but are relevant and should be of concern to the international community as a whole. These issues are being addressed in a wide variety of venues, including technical standards groups and other multistakeholder organizations looking at how to strengthen the security of the Internet’s architecture. We proceed from the perspective that the Internet and its associated networks are neither owned nor controlled by States. Rather than trying to regulate or control it, we view the role of states as one of many stewards — that is, caretakers, who work with all other stakeholders to ensure that this resource is available to all to reap positive benefits and rewards. This inclusive concept forms the basis for the multi stakeholder process and reflects the reality of how the Internet functions today. As one of these stewards, States must recognize our role(s) and focus our work on potential “value-add” contributions. In that respect, we recognize that States do have a well-established and important role to play with regard to facilitating transnational cooperation – including law enforcement cooperation – and seeking to prevent conflict and promote international stability. This role extends to the security of networked information systems. The challenge that we face as policy makers and practitioners is how to aggressively investigate, disrupt, and deter malicious activity online, including criminal and terrorist activity, while preserving the characteristics of the Internet that make it so vital to modern society. Our region has been leading the charge in navigating challenges in cyberspace since 2002. That was when we first came together as OAS member states to acknowledge that the benefits of information technology won’t be fully realized if the security and reliability of these systems are threatened. We agreed that we must find ways to ensure security and stability in cyberspace while protecting fundamental freedoms, creating opportunities for innovation, and promoting economic growth around the world. We concluded that no matter what steps individual states might take, national efforts, while necessary, are not themselves sufficient. Transnational cooperation is essential to our success on all fronts. That is why the United States has continued to support the OAS through CICTE, REMJA, and CITEL in building national cybersecurity strategies, developing new and stronger Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTS), educating the public about cybersecurity and staying safe online, and training technicians, law enforcement, and policy makers about cybersecurity best practices specific to their fields of work. We were pleased to support OAS in hosting its first cyber security meeting in January 2004 in Buenos Aires, an initiative which led to development of a hemispheric strategy that has established OAS leadership in this emerging field. And I am proud to note the progress we have made in implementing that strategy, adapting to and confronting challenges in cyberspace— both longstanding and new, by relying heavily on the strength of our federal, state, local, and international partnerships. We have shown that there is immense value in working cooperatively with one another and other key stakeholders to protect our networks, share best practices, and communicate regarding threats, investigations and prosecutions. I would note that the themes of our discussion this year are indicative of that progress. In addition to expressing our continued support for the OAS’s ongoing work on cybercrime and cybersecurity, I would like to take a few minutes today to encourage us to build on our past success. In particular, our work to address the numerous everyday challenges cyberspace presents could be augmented by new efforts to address the specific cyber challenges that could rise to the level of a national security concern. As cyber capabilities become more sophisticated, this concern is a growing possibility. Many states are developing military cyberspace capabilities — a prospect that is increasingly viewed as threatening both our national security and international security. In addition, key aspects of cyber tools — such as the difficulty of attributing an attack to its perpetrators or sponsors, and the dual-use nature of the technology — are seen by many as inherently destabilizing. To address this concern, the United States has developed and is promoting a strategic framework of international cyber stability, designed to achieve and maintain a peaceful cyberspace environment where all states are able to fully realize its benefits, where there are advantages to cooperate against common threats and avoid conflict, and where there is little incentive for states to engage in disruptive behavior or to attack one another. There are three key elements to this framework: global affirmation of the applicability of international law to state behavior in cyberspace; the development of international consensus on additional norms and principles of responsible state behavior in cyberspace that apply during peacetime; and the development and implementation of practical confidence building measures that can help ensure stability in cyberspace during times of crisis. In recent years, we have had great success in building international consensus as states coalesce around this framework. As the 2016 CICTE Declaration notes, the 2013 and 2015 reports of the UN Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) indicated consensus that international law applies to state conduct in cyberspace, affirmed the applicability of international law and laid out norms of responsible state behavior in cyberspace. The relatively swift affirmation of these concepts by states is notable and likely driven by an increased understanding among leaders and senior policymakers of the challenges and opportunities cyberspace presents to national security and foreign policy. One component of this framework — the development of regional cyber confidence building measures — was also highlighted in this year’s CICTE Declaration as a new potential area for practical regional work. We are pleased to see member states considering how CICTE can play a role in the development of such measures. CBMs have been used by the international community for decades to build confidence, reduce risk and increase transparency in other areas of transnational concern. Given the nature of cyberspace, CBMs can play a valuable role in building some confidence that normal operating behavior by states is somewhat predictable. Otherwise, activity in cyberspace could cause unintended reactions, miscalculation or misattribution - thus increasing risk of unintended conflict. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) have both been working on regional cyber CBMs and we have found the discussion very productive in those venues. In both venues, we are now at the stage of implementing specific regional cyber CBMs. It is our view that, taken together, peacetime norms of voluntary self-restraint and cooperation, coupled with existing international law and our work to pursue CBMs in cyberspace, will go a long way to achieving a more secure and stable cyberspace for everyone. If all states have an incentive to enjoy the benefits of cyberspace and little incentive to disrupt it, cyberspace can continue to be an engine for economic and social growth around the globe. Of course, affirmation of the applicability of international law and the development of additional, non-binding norms of responsible state behavior alone are not a silver bullet for all of the issues we face in cyberspace. We must also continue to address non-state threats and actors by developing better network security, cyber incident response capabilities, and enhancing international cooperation against cybercrime. We are doing that through, among other things, our capacity building efforts, including in building better cybersecurity and cybercrime capabilities and strengthening cooperation between and among technical computer response teams and law enforcement to deal with shared threats. I look forward to working with all of you to ensure that our region, working together and through the OAS, be it CICTE, REMJA, or CITEL, can continue to be a cohesive and progressive group.

TITLE: The New Face of Terrorism: Countering Violent Extremism in Cyberspace

TEXT: Good afternoon. I’m looking forward to our discussion, but before we begin our discussion I’d like to highlight a few points that I feel warrant our attention. What we are faced with today is not a new phenomenon, as we know. Illicit actors have utilized media sources to spread propaganda, engage in psychological warfare, and vilify a target population. We’ve seen this in a multitude of settings. We saw this during the Rwanda genocide, where the perpetrators of this mass atrocity utilized the radio in order to vilify a target population, polarize society, divide population on particular issues. At the time of the Rwanda genocide there were certain discussions on jamming the radio that was being utilized by perpetrators to spread messages of hate and to incite violence. However, these calls to do something to jam the radio signals were met with resistance. This inaction, as we all know, was very devastating. Hate messages spread. There were calls to take up arms, kill, and target an ethnic group within the population, and we know what the result was: Approximately 800,000 to 1 million individuals were killed. Here were are today faced with a comparable situation where we have terrorists that are utilizing social media in order to spread messages of hate and in order to call followers and supporters to take up arms and kill and otherwise harm an enemy others, a very broadly defined category. And not only are they using social media in order to call individuals to take up arms and harm others, but they’re also utilizing the media in order to terrorize target populations. And like Rwanda and similar situations in the past, we are currently faced with a similar resistance to do something proactive about it. Now we are faced with a similar impasse on what to do next because it is too difficult and too costly to do something about it proactively. And because of this impasse, social media is now being utilized by terrorists. It is serving now as an instrument of terrorism. Now, several social media platforms have gone on the record to state that terrorist accounts and the accounts of their supporters have no place on their platforms, and yet we’ve seen these accounts proliferate on their sites. Social media is providing these terrorists with unprecedented and unfettered access to millions of individuals around the globe. It is also giving terrorists exactly what they want – a stage to bring worldwide attention to their cause. I think we need to keep in mind that terrorism, the act of terrorism, is theater. Each act is designed to provoke a specific emotion, particularly fear. And it’s designed to elicit a desired response in the form of overreactions by the public, security professionals, and the government; and this overreaction can be in the form of discriminatory practices against the target population, a misidentified target population, or it can be in the form of expansive surveillance and police powers. Either way, this overreaction is sought by terrorists because terrorists believe that if certain individuals within the population are feeling victimized, then they’re most likely to sympathize with the terrorist cause. And it is these overreactions that terrorists seek in order to justify their cause and legitimize their actions. In light of this, terrorist use of social media should be quashed. And in order to accomplish this, what we need to do is ensure that these social media platforms are proactively monitoring, identifying, blocking, and ultimately removing terrorism-related content. Now, at the moment, what’s happening is reactive, right? Somebody makes a request to remove content, and these social media platforms make a decision as to whether or not to remove it. And the primary responsibility for finding this content online is placed on the public. This should not be the primary responsibility of the public. It should be the primary responsibility of the social media platforms. Because of these social media platforms’ hesitance and basic refusal to proactively take down these social media platforms, these accounts of these terrorists, what we’ve seen is certain groups like Anonymous come in and start taking down these accounts for them. In 2014 we saw Anonymous take down the terrorist account of the Ku Klux Klan after they threatened to use lethal force against protestors. In 2015 we saw Anonymous take down the terrorist accounts of ISIL, their supporters. What we need to remember is that these particular platforms are public – are private platforms and not public platforms. And what does this actually mean? This means that these social media platforms have the right to regulate conduct as they see fit, right? These rules of conduct are delineated in the social media platforms’ terms of services, and it is these terms of services that users must follow if they decide to use social platforms. Historically, these social media platforms have prohibited certain types of conduct – nudity, abuse, harassment, hate speech; more recently, terrorism. What I am advocating today is not the creation of a law or practice that will violate human rights, nor the expansion of law enforcement monitoring and surveillance powers to search social media content; instead, what I am advocating for is that these platforms proactively enforce their own terms of services. When such a responsibility is mentioned, usually it’s dismissed as being something that is unfeasible. Here’s the issue with that argument. These platforms are already being proactively monitored for a wide variety of other purposes – marketing, the identification of child pornography, copyrighted works, and more recently, abuse and harassment. And I’m going to use two examples as an illustration. Recently Twitter implemented a filtering program for abusive and harassing tweets. And what they’ve done is – this is automatic for every user. It will prevent a user from seeing an abusive or harassing tweet and having that tweet pop up on the user’s mention list. And this filtering program prevents users from opening up new accounts and reposting by checking the language that is utilized in the post to see if it fits any previous abusive or harassing statement, and checking the recency of the accounts, right. There’s also another program that’s utilized by Google. It’s called Content ID. Now, this is directed at copyrighted works, but what this program has done is it’s prevented individuals from uploading copyrighted work because it’s created a digital fingerprint for audio and video copyrighted work. So if another user tries to upload this video or audio work, what will happen is it will be blocked. My question is: Why can’t programs like these be modified in order to monitor, identify, block, and ultimately remove terrorism-related content on social media platforms? A limiting factor usually promoted to the proactive enforcement of terms of services is costs. Now, the proactive enforcement of terms of services will cost significant human and financial investments. However, this should not be an obstacle to its implementation. If it is serving as an obstacle to its implementation, then what we can do is provide financial incentives to these companies in the form of tax breaks in order to offset some of the costs that are incurred by engaging in these practices. In addition to proactively enforcing their terms of services, these social media platforms can also work with other key players to counter terrorist propaganda online. There’s an app that’s utilized by terrorists known as the Dawn of Glad Tidings, and particularly by ISIL terrorists. This app, when downloaded onto a user’s device and when the user registers for a service, will post pro-ISIL tweets to the user’s account and will do so in such a manner as to avoid any spam detection algorithms from Twitter. Why can’t we modify these types of apps or create new ones that can counter terrorist propaganda? Apart from the proactive enforcement of terms of services, the development of apps and programs that can counter terrorist propaganda, we should also ask several key players to leverage social media. And these key players can be law enforcement, other government organizations, private institutions, societal institutions, and the public at large to highlight any failures of terrorists, to discourage terrorist operatives and supporters, and finally, to delegitimize and discredit terrorist actions. And this can be in the form of highlighting inconsistencies and contradictions in their actions and in their ideologies. To some extent, this is occurring today; however, in order for it to have a lasting change, what we need done is to have these key players coordinate their responses, engage in these practices in a more continuous manner, and do so at a greater extent than it is occurring today. The reality is that there are solutions to dealing with terrorists’ use of social media. As such, it is not that key players cannot proactively deal with terrorists’ use of social media. It is that they won’t. And I think this is a good point to stop and open it up for questions, but – anyone want to ask a question? I can elaborate on a lot of these programs, but I hope what we do today is try to engage in a more constructive dialogue and understand that all of us have – can keep to our respective missions but still work towards dealing with the problem that we’re faced with today.

TITLE: Remarks for Panel Session "Development of Cyberspace and Emerging Challenges"

TEXT: Thank you for the opportunity to discuss developments of cyberspace and emerging challenges. Since our last ARF workshop on cyber issues, in Malaysia last year, we have seen an increasing variety of cyber threats and incidents. We have also continued to make progress in our international community’s approach to address these concerns. First, I’d like to briefly address the U.S. perspective on recent cyber incidents and trends. Incidents and trends. We all face increasing risks from state and non-state actors that conduct malicious cyber activity for unacceptable ends, including stealing trade secrets or personal information for commercial or financial gain, interfering with the exercise of freedom of expression, and intentionally damaging critical infrastructure. North Korea’s cyber attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment demonstrated the potential coercive effects of such activity. The recent targeted distributed denial of service attack against the code-sharing website Github and other cloud-based services highlights a new and worrying trend of cyber capabilities being used from abroad, which can have a negative impact on the enjoyment of freedom of expression within another country - in this instance, the United States. We are all increasingly dependent on networked information systems for the daily functioning of our societies. With that dependency has come increasing concern about new and existing vulnerabilities, the exploitation of which can make individuals targets of criminal actors operating on the Internet, and can now affect whole populations through threats to cyber- enabled infrastructures. These threats, we believe, can constitute threats to national security. As the U.S. Director of National Intelligence recently noted, the “likelihood of a catastrophic attack from any particular actor is remote at this time,” we are likely to see “an ongoing series of low-to-moderate level cyber attacks from a variety of sources” that will, over time, “impose costs on U.S. economic competitiveness and national security.” Given the global, interconnected nature of cyberspace, these threats and potential costs are not unique to the United States but are relevant and should be of concern to the international community as a whole. These issues are being addressed in a wide variety of venues, including technical standards groups and other multistakeholder organizations looking at how to strengthen the security of the Internet’s architecture. We proceed from the perspective that the Internet and its associated networks are neither owned nor controlled by States. Rather than trying to regulate or control it, we view the role of states as one of many stewards - that is, caretakers, who work with all other stakeholders to ensure that this resource is available to all to reap positive benefits and rewards. This inclusive concept forms the basis for the multi stakeholder process and reflects the reality of how the Internet functions today. Role of states/International cyber stability/norms. As one of these stewards, States must recognize our role(s) and focus our work on potential “value-add” contributions. In that respect, we recognize that States do have a well-established and important role to play with regard to facilitating transnational cooperation and seeking to prevent conflict and promote international stability. This role extends to the security of networked information systems. In this regard, the United States believes that the international community must work toward a framework of strategic international cyber stability: a more peaceful environment where all states are able to positively exploit the benefits of cyberspace and where there are benefits to cooperation and avoiding conflict and little incentive for states to disrupt or attack one another. There are two pillars to our approach: the development of international consensus on norms and principles of responsible state behavior in cyberspace and the development and implementation of practical cyber confidence building measures. We continue to make great strides in deepening common understandings around the application of international law to state behavior in cyberspace. The 2013 UN GGE report was a landmark achievement which affirmed the applicability of existing international law, including the UN charter, to state conduct in cyberspace. The recently concluded 2014-2015 GGE also resulted in consensus. The group made progress on issues related to international law: affirming the applicability of the inherent right to self-defense as recognized in Article 51 of the Charter, and noting the law of armed conflict’s fundamental principles of humanity, necessity, proportionality, and distinction. We also made important progress in building consensus on norms and principles of responsible state behavior in cyberspace. The 2015 report’s most significant achievement was its recommendations for voluntary norms of State behavior designed for peacetime. These included several concepts championed by the United States, such as the protection of critical infrastructure, the protection of computer incident response teams, and cooperation between States in responding to appropriate requests in mitigating malicious cyber activity emanating from their territory. Another important norm calls on States to seek to prevent the proliferation of cyber tools that can be used for malicious purposes. All of these measures, if observed, can contribute substantially to conflict prevention and stability in times of peace. These efforts do not conclude with this GGE round. We will continue to promote a broad consensus on how international law applies to State behavior in cyberspace wherever possible, engaging all receptive international partners. We will also continue to pursue an international consensus on a norm against State-sponsored cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property, trade secrets and other sensitive business information for commercial gain. This is a problem that predates cyberspace but has become much more acute because of the tremendous amounts of data that travel on networks or resides on servers. This activity, like some of the other issues addressed by the GGE's recommended norms, also has the potential to rise to the level of a national security concern. CBMs and ARF cyber work. In addition to our work on norms, cyber CBMs have the potential to contribute substantially to international cyber stability. CBMs have been used for decades to build confidence, reduce risk and increase transparency in other areas of transnational concern. In order to develop the international framework for a technology which has no external observables and cannot not be seen, cannot be counted, and where state capabilities cannot be easily assessed, we need to develop some confidence that normal operating behavior by states is somewhat predictable. Otherwise, any activity in cyberspace could cause unintended reactions, miscalculation or misattribution - thus increasing risk of unintended conflict. Given the ARF’s objective to “make significant contributions to efforts towards confidence-building and preventative diplomacy in the Asia-Pacific region” (agreed in 1994), we believe that the ARF has an important role to play in the development of regional cyber CBMs – a critical component of this framework of international cyber stability. We are satisfied with the consensus that has been reached following many months of negotiation on the ARF Work Plan on Security of and in the use of Information and Communications Technologies (ICTs). We look forward to its finalization at the ARF Ministerial meeting taking place next week. We believe that this Work Plan emphasizes the issues of common concern in the region where there are opportunities to make constructive progress in regional stability. We are prepared to continue working with willing ARF partners in the development of regional cyber confidence building measures to reduce risk and promote regional stability – an area of clear and established regional interest. The ARF Work Plan provides us with a number of tasks to focus our future work. In particular, the recommendation to develop a regional contact group to facilitate policy and technical communication about transnational cyber incidents seems ripe for productive discussion and implementation. We are currently working with Singapore on the development of the agenda for the next ARF Cyber Confidence Building Measures workshop this October, where we will aim to make progress on this set of activities. ARF cyber work and cyber capacity building. This workshop today is focused on cyber capacity building, which is an incredibly important topic. We should all recognize that all ARF member states will need to have the capacity to implement the cyber CBMs we are hoping to develop. Because our CBMs are voluntary, their effective implementation depends on the efforts and capacity of individual member states. Therefore, we should support the area of cyber capacity building linked directly to the tasks laid out for us in the ARF ICT security work plan. We should recognize that this is an important and complementary area for our work and I welcome the discussion happening today. Several years ago, the United Nations General Assembly put forward a cyber self-assessment tool in UNGA resolution 64/211. This resolution recommended that States develop a basic set of cyber capabilities and responsibilities. Some of these include: An understanding of the state’s cybersecurity needs and strategies for addressing them; A clear identification of key stakeholders with a role in cybersecurity and critical information infrastructure protection; Mechanisms for public-private cooperation on cybersecurity as well as formal and informal venues for government-industry collaboration on policy development; Coordination mechanisms for cyber incident management and recovery; Updated procedural and substantive legal frameworks for combatting cybercrime; and Efforts to develop a culture of cybersecurity. As we look to implementing ARF regional cyber CBMs, ARF member states should also be encouraging each other to carry out such a self-assessment and implement recommended steps in this regard. The need for capacity building and exchange of expertise on cyber issues is rapidly becoming one of the most important topics on the international cyber agenda. We will continue to work with all willing partners to strengthen the international community’s ability to keep cyberspace open, interoperable, secure and reliable. Conclusion. Thanks again for the opportunity to speak today. As I have explained, we are all working at a formative time in the effort to promote international peace and security in cyberspace. The ARF plays a critical role in this global effort.

TITLE: Testimony Before Policy Hearing Titled: 'Cybersecurity: Setting the Rules for Responsible Global Behavior'

TEXT: Chairman Gardner, Ranking Member Cardin, members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Subcommittee on East Asia, the Pacific, and International Cybersecurity Policy, it is a pleasure to be here today to speak about our cyber foreign policy. Before I begin, I would like to commend your Subcommittee for recently taking on “International Cybersecurity Policy” as a part of your portfolio. This development is yet another important step in our government’s efforts to strengthen our foreign policy on cyber issues. It is also further recognition of the growing importance of cyber policy to our national security, foreign policy, economy, values, and way of life. Moreover, the fact that cyber policy is the subject of the subcommittee’s first hearing during the legislative session indicates the importance you place on this new role. On behalf of my office and the State Department, I look forward to working with you. Cyber Issues: A New Foreign Policy Imperative. When it comes to the foreign policy implications of cyber issues, it is important to begin with the recognition that this Subcommittee and the State Department are working in a still- nascent policy space. While the Internet has been growing and evolving for a few decades now, the international community has only more recently begun to fully grasp cyber issues as a foreign policy priority. Only four years ago this month, the White House issued its International Strategy for Cyberspace, leading the world in recognizing the need for a comprehensive and crosscutting strategic approach to this key area. We were also the first country to establish a foreign ministry office like the one I lead —the State Department’s Office of the Coordinator for Cyber Issues— to coordinate diplomatic efforts across the full range of international cyber policy issues. The world has changed dramatically even since then. Now there are offices like ours in foreign ministries throughout the world, and new ones are steadily being created as more countries look to engage in the global cyber policy dialogue. Cyber issues have become central topics of discussion in virtually every international venue, and cyber diplomacy is increasingly viewed by governments as a foreign policy imperative. Nonetheless, cyber issues remain in many respects an emerging area of foreign and national security policy. The global community is still in an early stage of tackling these challenging issues and building consensus towards solutions that are consistent with the core values of democracy and human rights. In the United States, we have made great strides in articulating our strategic vision for cyberspace, but we are still working to fully develop the necessary capabilities to ensure we can continue to lead in this dynamic policy area and respond to crises as they emerge. These efforts occur in a context of growing threats—both technical and policy related— to the open and interoperable global Internet we seek to preserve and expand. On the technical side, we face increasing risks from state and non-state actors that conduct malicious cyber activity for the purpose of stealing trade secrets or personal information for commercial or financial gain, suppressing freedom of expression, destroying data, harming our critical infrastructure, or causing various other types of harm. North Korea’s cyber attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment demonstrated the potential coercive effects of such activity. The more recent targeting of Github highlights a new and worrying trend of cyber capabilities being used from abroad to influence public expression within the United States. While, as the Director of National Intelligence recently noted, the “likelihood of a catastrophic attack from any particular actor is remote at this time,” we are likely to see “an ongoing series of low-to-moderate level cyber attacks from a variety of sources” that will, over time, “impose costs on US economic competitiveness and national security.” In the policy context, we face significant and growing challenges, especially from China, Russia, and other authoritarian governments that seek increased sovereign control over the Internet and its content. These challenges surface in a variety of fora and across a range of policy issues. Internet governance is a prime example of a challenging cyber policy area. Here, we see governments that are more concerned with regime stability than with economic and social development pushing to shift from the long-standing and successful multistakeholder model— one that involves active participation by governments, the private sector, civil society, and academia in an inclusive and bottom-up process—to an intergovernmental and exclusive system that could fundamentally undermine the future growth and potential of the Internet. The fight against transnational cybercrime is another area where we face a policy challenge. China and Russia are aggressively advocating for a new global cybercrime agreement that would serve as a vehicle for controlling speech and undermining civil and political rights, while at the same time criticizing the effectiveness of existing international instruments like the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, or Budapest Convention. Our work to respond to these threats is guided by the vision of the U.S. International Strategy for Cyberspace, which seeks “to promote an open, interoperable, secure, and reliable information and communications infrastructure that supports international trade and commerce, strengthens international security, and fosters free expression and innovation.” The State Department—not just my office, but the full complement of security, economic, human rights, law enforcement and regionally-focused bureaus and offices throughout the Department—works across a range of interconnected cyber policy issues to achieve this vision through our diplomatic efforts. This includes promoting cyber stability among states through norms and confidence building measures, building the domestic cybersecurity capacity of our partners and channels for international cooperation on incident response, fighting cybercrime, advancing human rights online, promoting the continuation of an effective multistakeholder model of Internet governance, and, in cooperation with our colleagues at USAID among others, promoting capacity building, technical assistance, and development programs to tackle security challenges and address Internet access and affordability issues. Accordingly, my office works closely with offices and officials across the Department— including Under Secretary for Economic Growth, Energy, and the Environment, Catherine Novelli, who serves as the Senior Coordinator for International Information Technology Diplomacy; the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor; the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement; the Bureau of Economics and Business Affairs Office of International Communications and Information Policy; the Bureau of Counterterrorism; the Bureau of Arms Control and Verification; among other functional components, and every regional bureau. We also coordinate our work with colleagues throughout the Federal Government, including at the Departments of Defense, Justice, Homeland Security, Commerce, and Treasury. The State Department is a key player in all U.S. government interagency cyber policy processes, ensuring that timely and pertinent foreign policy guidance is provided to decision makers at all levels. Given the global nature of the Internet, even ostensibly domestic cyber policy decisions typically have a foreign policy or diplomatic dimension. We also leverage State’s global diplomatic corps, including our growing cadre of cyber officers, to support the vision articulated in the U.S. International Strategy for Cyberspace, and respond to growing threats. Review of the Global Cyber Landscape. Before describing our international priorities in detail, it is useful to review some of the most recent cyber developments from around the world to better frame the kinds of challenges and opportunities that we face. We can call it a short “cyber policy world tour.” Given the Subcommittee’s focus on East Asia and the Pacific, I will begin there. As you know, this dynamic region is playing an increasingly important role in the world, particularly in the area of cyber policy. Within the region, there is much focus on China’s role in cyberspace. In recent years, China has become more assertive in promoting its vision for cyberspace—government-controlled, with an absolutist conception of sovereignty over technology and content—that stands in stark contrast to our own policy priorities. As we push back against these repressive concepts, we also continue to engage China on areas of potential cooperation, such as network defense and other practical measures that could reduce the risk of conflict in cyberspace. At the same time, the Administration has been clear, consistent, and direct in raising our concerns with the Chinese regarding issues such as state-sponsored cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property for commercial gain. We have also been concerned by recent reports that China has used a new cyber capability to interfere with the ability of worldwide Internet users to access content hosted outside of China, including the web developer site Github. Although we regret China’s decision to suspend the activities of the U.S.-China Cyber Working Group, we have continued to engage Chinese cyber experts on areas of concern. We remain committed to expanding our cooperation with the Chinese government on cyber matters where we have common ground and to candidly and constructively addressing differences. The United States maintains strong and on-going diplomatic relations on cyber issues with a number of other countries in the region. We work very closely across the range of cyber policy topics with our friends in Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand, with whom we share a common vision for cyberspace. During Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s visit to Washington in April 2015, both the United States and Japan reaffirmed their commitment to working together “to ensure the safe and stable use of cyber space based on the free flow of information and an open internet.” The United States also engages on regional security issues in the ASEAN Regional Forum, where we are actively promoting the development of regional cyber confidence building measures. We are seeking to expand our bilateral engagement with several ASEAN states, including Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia, and actively promoting cybercrime capacity building efforts in the region in partnership with Japan and Australia. Finally, the region includes North Korea, which was responsible for the November 2014 cyber attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment. The destructiveness of that cyber attack, coupled with its coercive nature, sets it apart from other malicious cyber activity we have observed in recent years. This is why the President publicly attributed the cyber attack to North Korea and vowed that we would “respond proportionally . . . in a place and time and manner that we choose.” In January 2015, the President signed a new Executive Order, increasing our ability to apply sanctions pressure in response to the provocative, destabilizing, and repressive actions and policies of the government of North Korea, such as the destructive and coercive Sony Pictures cyber attack. Next, we can turn to Europe, which largely shares our vision for an open and secure Internet, but which still contains security and policy challenges. The United States has very close relations with much of Europe and our cooperation in the region on cyber issues is increasing. We engage directly with the European institutions on cyber, notably the European External Action Service (EAS). Working with the EAS, we have launched a U.S.-E.U. Cyber Dialogue to address the cyber foreign policy matters of mutual concern and align our foreign policy posture on key issues in international fora. My office leads regular bilateral engagements on cyber policy with individual countries like the United Kingdom, Germany, and France and has built regional collaborative engagements with the Nordic and Baltic countries, including a cyber partnership statement with Estonia. We have emerging engagements, including increased outreach from our embassies, with Spain, Portugal, and Italy, among others, as they have increasingly joined in global cyber policy discussions. Our bilateral engagements with some countries, primarily Germany, have been punctuated by continued reactions to unauthorized disclosures and allegations of NSA electronic surveillance activities. We continue to work closely with the Administration and our colleagues within the Department to address the concerns we hear from our foreign partners. While Eastern Europe has traditionally been the source—or conduit—for significant online criminal activity, there are numerous efforts underway at our embassies, and through other channels, to help build constructive engagement with a number of countries. This includes utilizing resources such as the International Visitor Leadership Program on one hand, and law enforcement capacity building and liaison programs on the other. As a result, we are starting to see some positive changes in national attitudes, most notably in Ukraine. Russia is obviously an important cyber actor on the international stage, where it continues to assert its repressive agenda on a wide range of cyber issues. We are closely watching and working to counter their efforts to impose greater state control over the Internet and undermine security and human rights online. Given Russia’s ongoing violation of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, the United States has suspended our bilateral cyber dialogue with Russia. Nevertheless, we continue to interact with Russia on multilateral efforts in the United Nations and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to build greater stability and reduce the risk of conflict among states in cyberspace, through the development of norms of responsible state behavior and cyber confidence building measures. As long as Russia advocates an anti-democratic world view on cyber policy issues, we must work with our international partners to counter its destabilizing policies and activities. The Middle East is a complex place, and we can see cyber issues becoming an increasingly important feature of the already multifaceted security and human rights challenges facing the region. There are real dangers of malicious cyber activity becoming enmeshed within—and potentially escalating—existing regional rivalries, and we have seen groups like ISIL harness the Internet as a tool for terrorist purposes. To guard against these threats, we are committed to working with our international partners in the region, including Israel and the Gulf states, to build a shared understanding of the threat, develop effective strategies and policy, and shore up vulnerabilities, especially in critical infrastructure. Through all of our efforts, we will help protect key U.S. interests and promote regional stability. Of course, promoting cybersecurity cannot come at the expense of the open Internet, which provides a tremendous set of opportunities for economic growth in a region that will be key to long-term development and stability. South and Central Asia is a region where, despite challenges in some countries, we see new opportunities for engagement and growth. India is pursuing an exciting “Digital India” agenda and is making progress on developing its cybersecurity capabilities. Its dynamic civil society, private industry, and technology sectors are increasingly playing leadership roles in cyber policy issues, such as Internet governance. With our shared democratic values, robust economic relationship, and people-to-people ties, the United States is primed for close strategic cooperation with India on the full range of cyber issues, and we are eager to strengthen our engagement. When Prime Minister Modi visited the United States in September 2014, we agreed to develop closer cybersecurity cooperation and to reinitiate our whole-of-government Cyber Consultations, which we look forward to pursuing this summer. We are also seeing leadership on cyber issues elsewhere in the region—for instance, Sri Lanka is taking important steps towards becoming the first state in the region to join the Budapest Convention, which will enable it to be a strong partner in combating global cybercrime. Other states are still figuring out how to grapple with cybersecurity and cybercrime challenges, but they are increasingly aware of the economic opportunities an open and interoperable Internet brings and increasingly paying attention. Closer to home, within the Western Hemisphere we are presented with numerous opportunities to build stronger partnerships on the range of cyber issues, working bilaterally, within regional bodies like the Organization of American States (OAS), with civil society and with the private sector. The United States has had long-standing relationships with important actors in this region, including Canada with which we have a shared perspective on cyber policy. Brazil is another important actor on cyber policy, and I co-lead a bilateral whole-of-government working group with the Brazilians on Internet and ICT policy. As more people within the region gain reliable access to the Internet, more governments are recognizing the need to develop a coordinated strategic approach to cyber policy. With support from the United States and other partners in the region, the OAS has successfully trained law enforcement, judicial experts, and policy makers on the importance of increasing cybersecurity and combatting cybercrime. We believe that the OAS work, along with our longstanding efforts to engage bilaterally in the hemisphere, have contributed to the fact that nine Latin American countries are now in various stages of joining the Budapest Convention. Countries like Jamaica, Colombia, Costa Rica, and Chile are making a concerted effort to consult across ministries and to include experts from a variety of local sectors as they develop new legislation, update digital agendas, and craft cybersecurity strategies. Countries like Argentina and Uruguay are honing the skills of their workforce and working to expand their community of cyber experts from urban centers to rural areas. Taken as a whole, our friends in the region are working towards a truly cyber-savvy citizenry, and we are supporting that growth by strengthening existing partnerships and seeking new opportunities for engagement. The final region on our tour, but certainly not last in our list of priorities, is Africa, a region with relatively low but fast-growing Internet penetration and a strong incentive to build an open, secure and interoperable Internet as an engine for economic growth. As the use of the Internet and mobile phones expands throughout sub-Saharan Africa, nations are faced with a corresponding increase in the number of cyber threats. Vulnerable networks erode the development benefits of ICTs and pose economic and security challenges to individuals, nations and the international community. Yet this same technology is contributing to stronger democratic institutions, boosting broad-based economic growth through trade and investment, advancing peace and prosperity, and promoting opportunity and development. This is why African nations have been a significant focus of my office’s Foreign Assistance programming. We are working with African leaders and citizens in an enduring, multi-faceted partnership on cyber issues—one that is not about overnight solutions or one-off deals, but instead focuses on long-term collaborative efforts among all stakeholders. We are bringing key partners together bilaterally, while working multilaterally with the African Union Commission (AUC) and key Regional Economic Communities to help our partners build and shape effective and sustainable cyber architecture that serves Africa on a regional and global scale. This includes continuing our tradition of training and engagement on cybersecurity best practices, building the requisite legal frameworks for states and individuals to combat the threat of cybercrime, working to maintain open and unfettered access for all Africans, and encouraging African voices and perspectives in the very relevant conversation we are having on how states should work together to prevent cyber conflict. These were the topics of utmost interest to African officials I met in June 2014 when I joined colleagues from across the Southern African Development Community for a four-day cyber policy training session—the fourth regional workshop in a series that we have presented across the continent—and they will continue to be the focus of our work on the continent in 2015. Lastly, our cyber world tour would not be complete without discussing the cyber policy debates that are currently taking place in multilateral venues. Here the picture is complicated by the fact that there is a multitude of fora that address the range of cyber issues. For our work in promoting international security and stability in cyberspace, we look to the United Nations and within regional security organizations like the OSCE and the ASEAN Regional Forum. Issues around cybercrime are dealt with in fora like the Council of Europe and the United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime (UNODC). However, cyber issues do not only arise in traditional international fora. Dynamic and decentralized multistakeholder venues that include representation from the private sector and civil society as well as states play a key role in Internet governance, and we work with this range of stakeholders to promote our vision for the Internet. It is within multilateral venues that we most frequently encounter the types of policy threats that I noted earlier. Countries like Russia and China use these venues to press for greater government control over the Internet, for example, by advocating that the International Telecommunication Union take a greater role in Internet governance and pushing for a United Nations cyber treaty. To date, the United States has worked very effectively with likeminded countries to stave off the challenges in these venues. At the same time, there have been a number of successes in multilateral fora, particularly on security issues, as discussed below. Cyber Policy Priorities. This is the world that we face. I am optimistic about our ability to respond to the threats, build cyber stability and resilience, and ultimately continue to capitalize on the rich economic and expressive opportunities that the Internet offers us. But there is much work to be done. I want to spend some time now talking about what the State Department is doing to support whole-of-government efforts to engage the world that we have just toured on cyber policy issues. Security and Cybercrime. With respect to security issues, our long term vision is to strive for a state of “international cyber stability”: a more peaceful environment where all states are able to enjoy the benefits of cyberspace; where there are benefits to state-to-state cooperation and avoiding conflict; and where there is little incentive for states to attack one another. We are pursuing efforts along two lines to achieve this longer term goal. First, we are working to develop a shared understanding about norms of responsible state behavior in cyberspace, which will help enhance stability, ground foreign and defense policies, guide international partnerships, and help prevent the misunderstandings that can lead to conflict. In recent years, we have had tangible successes in developing these norms. The 2013 UN Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security (GGE)—a group of fifteen countries that included the United States as well as countries like Russia and China—reached a landmark consensus that international law applies to state conduct in cyberspace. In the current round of the GGE, we are working to build on this important consensus with an even broader group and look more closely at how international law applies to state conduct in cyberspace. As part of these efforts, the United States has also been considering what voluntary measures of self-restraint states should implement, since cyber tools can be used across the spectrum of conflict, most notably below the threshold of the use of force. Accordingly we have sought to identify some voluntary norms of responsible state behavior during peacetime that would be universally appropriate and that will keep all of us safer if states adopt them. They include: A State should not conduct or knowingly support online activity that intentionally damages critical infrastructure or otherwise impairs the use of critical infrastructure to provide services to the public. A State should not conduct or knowingly support activity intended to prevent national CSIRTs from responding to cyber incidents. A State should also not use CSIRTs to enable online activity that is intended to do harm. A State should cooperate, in a manner consistent with its domestic law and international obligations, with requests for assistance from other States in investigating cyber crimes, collecting electronic evidence, and mitigating malicious cyber activity emanating from its territory. States must take robust and co-operative action to investigate criminal activity by non-State actors. A State should not conduct or knowingly support cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property, including trade secrets or other confidential business information, with the intent of providing competitive advantages to its companies or commercial sectors. These voluntary measures are beginning to gain traction internationally. During the current round of the GGE, we proposed the inclusion of several of these norms in the group’s draft report and many states have spoken positively about their inclusion. In addition, on the occasion of Prime Minister Abe’s recent visit to Washington, Japan and the United States released a leaders-level statement that affirmed that states should uphold additional, voluntary norms of state behavior in cyberspace during peacetime, noting that wide affirmation among states would contribute to international stability in cyberspace. Australia’s Foreign Minister also affirmed some of these concepts in recent remarks. Second, in addition to promoting norms, our international security work has also focused on the establishment of practical cyber risk reduction and confidence building measures (CBMs), which are intended to reduce the risk of escalation due to misunderstanding or miscalculation regarding a cyber incident of national security concern emanating from U.S. or another country’s territory. The first ever bilateral cyber CBMs were announced by President Obama and President Putin in June 2013. And in December 2013, at the ministerial of the OSCE, we achieved an agreement among the 57 participating states for the first ever cyber CBMs for a multinational security organization. We are now working to implement the current CBMs, and we are also pursuing the development of cyber CBMs in other regional organizations, such as the ASEAN Regional Forum. Alongside these efforts, and with a shorter term focus, we are working to strengthen the ability of the U.S. government as well as our foreign partners to respond to cyber events as they occur. We strongly favor increased direct international cooperation among Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) and law enforcement entities to respond to and investigate cyber incidents, and we use our diplomatic engagements to support the building of those ties. Among our foreign partners, we encourage the development of whole-of-government national strategies as well as cooperation with the private sector on cybersecurity matters. When incidents occur, we stand ready to support the whole-of-government response. State, as the lead foreign policy agency, plays a key role in interagency deliberations on major cyber events, and it engages diplomatic channels where needed. For example, during the 2012­2013 distributed denial of service attacks against financial institutions, State used diplomatic channels as a supplement to incident response efforts through more technical channels, ensuring that policy makers in foreign governments were aware of U.S. requests for assistance. More recently, in response to the cyber attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment, we were pleased to see a number of foreign partners come to our support in condemning North Korea’s actions. We have also used diplomatic channels to raise concerns regarding the cyber-enabled theft of trade secrets for commercial gain. Beyond these efforts, State has supported the Administration’s on-going efforts to fully develop its toolkit for deterring and responding to cyber threats. For example, we participated in the development and release of the recently announced Executive Order 13694, which allows for the targeted imposition of financial sanctions against persons engaging in certain significant malicious cyber-enabled activities that are reasonably likely to result in, or have materially contributed to, a significant threat to the national security, foreign policy, or economic health or financial stability of the United States. State also works closely with Department of Justice colleagues to strengthen international cooperation to combat trans-national cybercrime and other forms of high-tech crime. The continued expansion of the Budapest Cybercrime Convention – which has 45 parties representing the Americas, Europe, Asia, the Pacific, and Africa, and more than a dozen additional countries in the final stages of joining – demonstrates the growing realization by governments around the world that cybercrime must be tackled head on, using a consistent and proven legal framework, in order to eliminate criminal safe-havens. Another key tool in our arsenal to counter high-tech crime is the G-7 24/7 Network which allows the national police in seventy countries to request rapid assistance in significant investigations involving digital evidence. The State Department is committed to working with like-minded partners around the globe to build both the will and capacity to effectively counter cybercrime, and we will continue to devote significant resources to that goal. 2. Internet Governance and Internet Freedom. We have also seen some recent successes in the areas of Internet governance and promoting human rights online, and we continue to take those efforts forward. In 2014, our work to maintain the current multistakeholder system was bolstered by the U.S. government announcement of the intent to transfer key Internet domain name functions to the global multistakeholder community; the strong, multistakeholder, consensus-based outcome of the NETmundial conference in Brazil; and the successful completion of the ITU Plenipotentiary Conference in Busan, South Korea, where, with the leadership of my colleague, Ambassador Daniel Sepulveda, we achieved a consensus that avoided expanding or establishing any new mandates for the ITU related to Internet governance or cybersecurity. This year, we are looking forward to the tenth annual Internet Governance Forum, which will take place in Brazil. The IGF continues to provide a venue for global, multistakeholder dialogue on Internet policy issues that alleviates the need for a more centralized, intergovernmental approach to decisions about how the Internet works and the policies surrounding it. A decision about whether to extend the IGF’s mandate will be taken later this year by the UN General Assembly as part of their 10-Year Review of the World Summit on the Information Society—the so called WSIS+10 review. The focus of this year’s review will be on the growth of the Information Society, essentially ICTs for development, over the last ten years. We believe there has been tremendous progress, as shown by the exceptional growth of the Internet around the world. Nonetheless, going forward, we will focus our attention and collective efforts on practical measures to close the remaining gaps in access and capacity. The United States can also count successes in our efforts to promote Internet freedom and human rights online, thanks in large part to the efforts of State’s Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor (DRL). At the core of our policy approach is the maxim that the same human rights that people have offline also apply online—a view that was adopted by the UN Human Rights Council in a 2012 resolution and reaffirmed again in 2014 —and this position is mainstreamed across all of State’s work, including our efforts to promote cybersecurity and fight cybercrime. Together with my colleague Tom Malinowski, Assistant Secretary of State for DRL, I have just returned from this year’s meeting in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, of the Freedom Online Coalition, a group of now 26 governments committed to taking concrete action in support of Internet freedom. Programmatically, DRL works with USAID, our Near East Asia bureau and others, to support advocates who promote freedom online, as well as the development of technologies that assist in those efforts. 3. Bilateral Engagements. State’s cyber diplomacy also focuses specifically on our bilateral relationships with a number of key countries. Bilateral engagements, or engagements with smaller groupings of countries, provide a valuable opportunity to share views with partners, identify areas of agreement, address differences of opinion, and develop areas for cooperation. State has pioneered a whole-of-government model for conducting bilateral engagements on cyber policy issues, which brings together cyber policy experts from across our government (for example, from DoD, Justice, DHS, and Commerce) to engage simultaneously with foreign government counterparts. We find that this approach helps avoid uncoordinated discussions between individual agencies on certain topics and at times has the added benefit of encouraging interagency cooperation among our partners. We are currently conducting formal whole-of-government cyber dialogues with Germany, the Republic of Korea, Japan, the European Union, and the eight Nordic-Baltic states, and we are in the process of reinvigorating dialogues with Brazil and India. As mentioned earlier, we also have official dialogues with China and Russia, both of which are presently suspended. We also regularly engage with Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom in both formal and informal settings, consistent with our close relationship across the spectrum of security issues. In addition, the State Department conducts less formal cyber bilateral engagements with a number of countries and multilateral organizations. Finally, it should be noted that there are a number of other State policy dialogues that complement our efforts, such as the ICT policy dialogues that Ambassador Sepulveda’s office in the Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs leads with key economic partners as well as the human rights dialogues led by DRL. 4. Capacity Building. The State Department and USAID are actively working to build the capacity of foreign governments across a range of interconnected cyber policy issues—with a principal focus on expanding internet access through innovation, improving domestic cybersecurity through the development of CSIRTs and national strategies, improving the ability to fight cybercrime and other forms of high-tech crime, and ensuring the ability to cooperate with global partners to address shared threats. Recently, the U.S. became a founding member of the Global Forum for Cyber Expertise, which was launched on April 16, 2015, during the Dutch-hosted Global Conference on Cyberspace in The Hague, reaffirming our commitment to cyber capacity building. In particular, recognizing that our ability to fight transnational cybercrime and respond to foreign cyber threats is greatly impacted by the strength of our international partners, State, including our Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, is working with colleagues at the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security to build the capacity of foreign governments to secure their own networks as well as investigate and prosecute cybercriminals within their borders. Working with multilateral organizations like the AUC, the UNODC (via its Global Cybercrime Capacity Building Program), the Council of Europe, the European Union, the G-7, and the OAS, we promote cybercrime policies in line with the Budapest Convention and share cybersecurity best practices, such as writing national cyber strategies, forming cybersecurity incident response teams, and promoting public awareness campaigns on good cybersecurity practice. Most recently, at the end of fiscal year 2014, my office obligated over $1 million of our limited foreign assistance funds to Carnegie Mellon University’s Software Engineering Institute, a federally funded research and development center, to begin a project in Sub-Saharan Africa on cybersecurity incident response and incident management capabilities and coordination. We are hopeful that this and related efforts can expand and serve as a model for future capacity building assistance programs. We believe that cybercrime and cybersecurity capacity building overall must be a priority for the U.S. Government going forward. If they are not adequately addressed by the United States and key partners, then we run the risk that as the Internet continues to expand in the developing world, it will do so without necessary cybersecurity safeguards, creating global risks and undermining the conditions necessary to realize the economic and social benefits offered by expanded broadband access. 5. Mainstreaming Cyber Policy at State. Last, we are working to mainstream cyber policy issues across State and USAID, so that we can more effectively leverage both personnel and budget resources as tools for implementing our cyber policies. Nearly every bureau within the Department—whether regional or functional—now plays some role in cyber policy making. To prioritize our engagements and resources, we have worked with our regional bureaus to develop cyber-specific regional strategies focusing on key partners in each part of the world. To better leverage our embassies in implementing these regional strategies, we have brought 163 State Foreign Service Officers and USAID employees from 121 Missions together with U.S. Government experts through an innovative new training program created by my office to train diplomatic officers and support them in their own local cyber engagements. To identify resources and needs, we worked to incorporate cyber priorities into Department budget planning efforts. While this line of work does not involve actual engagement with foreign partners, it is an important part of building our government’s capabilities to advance cyber policy issues going forward. Conclusion. Thank you for the opportunity to provide State’s perspective on global cyber issues and on our international cyber priorities. We look forward to working with the Subcommittee towards protecting our security here at home and ensuring that all of us can continue to benefit from an open, interoperable, secure, and reliable global Internet.

TITLE: Department of Commerce Cybersecurity Trade Mission to Romania and Poland

TEXT: Great. Well, thank you, and first of all good morning and thank you for joining us today for the opportunity to talk about our upcoming trade mission to Romania and Poland. Helping American businesses to take advantage of new opportunities abroad and to help build business partnerships is one of the top priorities of the Department of Commerce.  From coast to coast, exports have played a critical role in the United States economy and in helping to continue to grow. And it’s clear that in today’s global economy American prosperity is directly tied to our ability to both open new markets but also to work with allies in finding opportunities that are win-wins for both of our economies. That’s why President Obama and our entire Administration are laser-focused on opening new markets to businesses of all sizes from across the country. One of the ways that the Department of Commerce helps to promote American companies abroad is through trade missions. And as you know and as Mike mentioned, that I’ll be leading a trade mission next week with 20 U.S. cyber security companies to Romania and Poland. U.S. cyber security firms are industry leaders providing cutting-edge technologies, products, and services all over the globe.  And our delegation will be a real mix of companies from large companies to new-to-market companies as well as U.S. cyber companies looking to expand their presence in the region. A number of them are already present in the region, which is also exciting because they’ve already started working with various governments and companies throughout the region. So given the cross-country nature – given the cross-cutting nature of this sector, the mission offers an immense economic opportunity as well as the broader strategic advantages for our companies and for the countries.  While we’re there, we’re going to participate in a cyber security regional summit with government leaders from across Central and Southeast Asia – or Southeast Europe, sorry, not Asia.  I’m honored to co-lead the summit with Sorin Grindeanu, the Romanian minister for information society. We will also celebrate the opening of a new cyber security innovation center in Bucharest, Romania, funded in part by the U.S. Trade and Development Agency and Fidelis Cybersecurity. This new center will really stand as a model and show how public-private partnership, how governments and companies can work together to effectively combat cyber crime and cyber attacks.  With an uptick in cyber security attacks across Europe, the need for improvements in the ICT infrastructure is more important than ever before, and the United States is committed to helping our European allies protect themselves from cyber security threats. Because the digital economy is inherently global, I know many American companies have concerns about how new cyber security laws abroad will affect the way they operate, conduct business, and develop new products and services that are compatible around the world.  While we’re there we will meet with government officials in order to discuss from across the region about ensuring that their cyber security policies are rooted in international standards and industry best practices.  I will urge them to consult with their private sector when developing new cyber security requirements so that there’s a compatibility and a partnership of how they all work together. And our delegation will also meet with local companies and business groups, including the American Chambers of Commerce in both countries to form new partnerships and to look for new opportunities.  Through the trade mission we hope to help the economies of Eastern Europe build confidence in the business climates.  This will, in turn, benefit U.S. companies that are already present in or looking to enter these new markets. I would be happy to take any questions you have.

TITLE: New Reward for Cyber Fugitive

TEXT: ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL CALDWELL: Thank you, and thank you all for joining us and good afternoon.  Today we’re going to announce an award for – a reward, excuse me – for information leading to the arrest and/or conviction of Evgeniy Bogachev, an alleged leader of a tightly-knit gang of cyber criminals based in Russia and the Ukraine who are responsible for the development and operation of both the GameOver Zeus and Cryptolocker malware.  GameOver Zeus was one of the most sophisticated and damaging botnets that’s ever been created.  It infected more than 500,000 computers, up to even maybe more than a million computers worldwide. It caused more than $100 million in financial losses just in the United States alone. On top of that, the Cryptolocker ransomware infected more than 250,000 computers worldwide. It targeted companies – big companies, small companies – and individuals. In May and June of 2014, we were able to gain control of the GameOver Zeus botnet from the criminals, and also we were able to take the Cryptolocker ransomware offline. This was thanks to an unprecedented action by the FBI, law enforcement in more than 10 countries, and the private sector. Today, due to the work of the FBI and our partners, GameOver Zeus has been neutralized, is out of the criminals’ hands, and Cryptolocker remains inactive. But one significant part of the puzzle remains incomplete, and that is that Mr. Bogachev remains at large.  Although we were able to significantly disrupt GameOver Zeus and the Cryptolocker criminal enterprise, we have not yet brought Mr. Bogachev to justice. We must not allow international borders to shield criminals from the law. As the cyber threat grows and more nations join in the international fight against cybercrime, the number of countries that were once perceived as sanctuaries for criminals will shrink.  It is shrinking, and it will continue to shrink. In the case of Bogachev, the same international coalition that brought down his botnet and his ransomware is now chasing him.  We appreciate the State Department shining a light on this issue and on this important case today with this reward.  This reward is going to reinvigorate the efforts to find Bogachev, and it’s also very importantly going to encourage others to help us find him. And I’m confident that with these efforts, Bogachev will one day be brought to justice in the United States. Thank you. ASSISTANT SECRETARY BROWNFIELD: Thank you very much, Leslie.  Madam Assistant Attorney General, assistant director, and distinguished United States attorney for the western district of Pennsylvania, distinguished members of the media, good afternoon, and thank you all very much for allowing me to participate in this event this afternoon. Ladies and gentlemen, I am not going to talk about an investigation, a case, or a prosecution, because people far more talented and far more experienced than me are here to talk about that. I am instead going to talk about the President’s strategy to combat transnational organized crime, endorsed and approved by President Obama in 2011 and endorsed by the United States Congress with its authorization and legislation to support a Transnational Organized Crime, or TOC, Rewards Program. This program, ladies and gentlemen, which is barely two years old, began in 2013 with an offer of a major reward for information leading to the arrest and prosecution of members of the world’s largest wildlife trafficking organization.  Since then, rewards have been offered for individuals involved in international smuggling, illicit finance, and internet fraud. It has been successful. In only two years, we have provided payments of more than $20 million in following up on reward offers under the TOC Reward Program. And to put that in some perspective for you, our international narcotics reward program, which is nearing 30 years of age, has paid out somewhat in excess of $88 million over this time frame. Twenty million over two years versus 88 million over nearly 30.  I suggest to you that this reward program is having an impact. We are today announcing, as the assistant attorney general has just said, a new reward offer of $3 million related to Mr. Evgeniy Mikhaylovich Bogachev, perhaps one of the most serious cyber criminals found on Planet Earth today, responsible, we believe, for losses of more than $100 million by innocent individuals and legitimate businesses in the United States of America alone.  We hope that this reward offer will In fact lead to resolution of this case and justice in this matter.  We are prepared to work with all governments of the world in bringing this case to successful conclusion. But ladies and gentlemen, this reward offer is perhaps somewhat larger than just this specific case.  This is a major reward offer related to cybercrime, and for those of you who have perhaps been asleep for the last 20 or 30 years, or do not own a computer nor ever have used the internet, you may be unaware of it.  But for everyone else, this is perhaps the most dangerous criminal enterprise and activity that we are confronting in the 21st century.  If this reward has as a consequence the possibility of making potential cyber criminals aware of the risks and willing to leave us alone and take their talents somewhere else, then I suggest to you we have all gained and benefited from this reward. I thank you very much.  Dr. D, over to you. MR. DEMAREST: Thank you, Ambassador Brownfield. Thank you very much for that.  Assistant Attorney General Leslie Caldwell, and of course, my good friend, U.S. Attorney Dave Hickton.  Good afternoon.  My name is Joe Demarest. I’m the assistant director of the cyber division for the FBI.  I’m joined with State Department and Department of Justice and my colleagues from the western district of Pennsylvania U.S. attorney’s office to update our case against Evgeniy Bogachev in announcing this reward. And I have to thank the Department of State and the Transnational Organized Crime Program for offering and working with the FBI and Department of Justice to offer this $3 million reward that leads – or hopefully for information that leads to his arrest and/or conviction of Mr. Bogachev. Mr. Bogachev is wanted for his role in creating and administering GameOver Zeus botnet and the Cryptolocker malware that infected thousands of computers, as Ms. Caldwell mentioned, worldwide, to the cost of millions of dollars. The scheme wasn’t one targeted heist, obviously.  It affected many people and organizations, all simply opening – by opening an email. This was a sophisticated scheme in every way, from the malware design to the setup of the organization to use money mules, or people to move money from bank account to bank account to evade us in law enforcement. To give you an example of how sophisticated this attack was or this botnet was and how it affected the everyday Americans, the FBI uncovered in our investigation the following:  In November 2012, a regional bank in northern Florida had nearly $7 million fraudulently wired out of one of its accounts. The bank maintained an account at a larger correspondent bank – that’s a bank that provides services to other banks rather than to businesses or individuals. On November 6th, 2012, a fraudulent wire transfer was initiated from the correspondent bank account to an account in Switzerland. Although the correspondent bank’s records show that the wire was initiated by an employee of the Florida bank, the employee denied initiating and authorizing the wire transfer. Subsequently, an FBI investigation confirmed that a computer at the Florida bank was infected with the GameOver Zeus malware and that the infected computer was used to steal the credentials that were used to initiate the fraudulent wire. Another example: In August of 2009, a dairy in Ohio fell victim to a phishing email and subsequently suffered the loss of approximately $300,000. The email was disguised to look as if it was being sent from a bank used by the company or dairy. Upon the opening of the email, the company became victim to the Zeus malware. In December 2009, a small Catholic nonprofit society that has served the community of Chicago for over 114 years fell victim to the malware known as Zeus and subsequently suffered a loss of approximately $130,000. A member of the society received an email which was disguised to look as if being sent by a known sender.  Upon opening the email, the computer was infected, again, with the Zeus malware. Bogachev, in his role, worked as an administrator along with his co-conspirators to distribute the malware through phishing schemes and spam. Bogachev is also alleged to be the creator of the ransomware Cryptolocker. Both GameOver Zeus and Cryptolocker targeted and infected computers worldwide – as Ms. Caldwell had mentioned, 500,000 to potentially over 1 million. With the U.S.-led mitigation efforts, there has been reduction in GameOver Zeus infections by almost 85 percent in the U.S., and globally about 81 percent. The idea was to attack or at least conduct enforcement operations as we mitigate the botnet, the infrastructure used by the botnet or the actors. The keys to Cryptolocker were uncovered by FireEye and Fox-IT and put on a portal through the Department of Homeland Security emergency readiness team US-CERT website for victims to decrypt their computers. More than 2,900 victims were able to unlock the encryption that Cryptolocker installed or used. As I said, this was a worldwide infection, but it also had implications and teaming, with law enforcement globally working to combat and bring to justice the criminal organization and people behind it. And I would like to thank our partners, the Australian federal police; the national police of the Netherlands’ National High-Tech Crime Unit, their European cybercrime center; UK’S NCA, National Crime Agency; the Ukraine’s ministry of internal affairs, the Dutch national police High-Tech Crime Unit; BKA, or the German criminal police; the French judicial police; the Italian national police; the Swedish national police; Turkish national police – as you can see the national, international flavor of these investigations – the Switzerland Federal Office of Police; Luxembourg Police Grand-Ducale; Japan’s national police agency; New Zealand police; and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. We are turning the world again for assistance – or turning to the world again for assistance in locating Bogachev. While he is known to reside in Russia, he may in fact travel. With the $3 million reward, what we’re hoping it would cause incentive for someone somewhere who may see him and report to the authorities his whereabouts by contacting the local authorities or the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate and sending that information on to the FBI. Obviously, all the information that is reported would be kept strictly confidential. The charges brought against the prolific cybercriminal and the reward funds now available are a resulted of dedicated and hard work of FBI agents who’ve spent countless hours both here and abroad. I would like to recognize the special agents who were actually in charge of this investigation, Jim Craig, Sarah Cain (ph), Elliott Peterson, and Steve Lampo, along with the leadership of the two respective offices involved, our Omaha office and our Pittsburgh office – the supervisors Justin Kolenbrander and Keith Mularski, and our assistant special agents in charge, Michael Christman, Michael Kitsmiller.  Would also like to thank and acknowledge the leadership of the offices, the heads of the offices, both Scott Smith and Tom Metz. Brilliant work by those officers in working with our colleagues overseas. The progress we made on this case and the response to reduce the infections would not be possible without those in the private sector. Calling out Dell SecureWorks, Fox-IT, and Krautzwerig (ph) were among the chief, and also our partners at DOJ. Without them, all of this would not have been possible. So let this reward also be notice to other cyber criminals seeking refuge abroad, thinking they are out of the reach of U.S. law enforcement, the FBI, along with our partners. We’ll use every authority and power we have to identify, pursue, and bring those to justice who violate the law. Thank you very much. MR. HICKTON: I’m very pleased to be here today and to share the podium with the assistant attorney general, the ambassador, and the assistant director for today’s important announcement. Today is a further demonstration of our resolve to bring cybercriminals to justice. The commitment of a whole-of-government approach using an all-tools arsenal is the only way to defeat transnational cyber criminals who proceed through the dark of the internet to commit insidious, malicious intrusions which threaten our security. The case against Evgeniy Bogachev was charged in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, was taken down in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and involved court orders signed by a federal judge in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to sever the lines of communication between the illegal GameOver Zeus network and the infected computers. But this was truly a team effort. It was based first upon the superb investigative work of the FBI, the important cooperation and collaboration of the district of Nebraska, and, of course, the criminal division of the Department of Justice. We also had unprecedented support, as Joe mentioned, from 10 other nations as well as our private sector partners. The weekend-long technical takedown began on May 30th, 2014 with the coordinated seizure of computer servers in multiple countries that formed the backbone of GameOver Zeus and Cryptolocker. Working feverishly around the clock, our team freed infected computers from the botnet network and helped unwitting victims regain control of their own computers. We were compelled to act against Bogachev and GameOver Zeus network to protect and vindicate thousands of victims in western Pennsylvania and around the world. To achieve justice in cyber space, we must be aggressive, innovative, and relentless to ensure that those living outside our borders do not have a pass to commit crimes within them. We are ready to bring Evgeniy Bogachev to justice in federal court in Pittsburgh. We will use every available legal and diplomatic means to bring all cyber criminals to justice wherever they reside. Thank you.

TITLE: The North Korean Threat: Nuclear, Missiles and Cyber

TEXT: Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Engel, and Members of the Committee, thank you for inviting me today, along with my colleagues from Treasury and DHS, to testify about North Korea. I particularly appreciate your convening this hearing early as the new Congress begins its work. North Korea is one of the most difficult and complicated challenges the United States faces. As we respond to its destabilizing, provocative, and repressive policies and actions around the world, we appreciate the interest and attention you and the Committee have given to this issue. DPRK Behavior. In recent weeks, Mr. Chairman, the American people and international community have been deeply troubled by the destructive and coercive cyber attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment, and the subsequent threats of violence against American movie theaters and moviegoers. An extensive FBI investigation has concluded that this attack was conducted by the government of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. The Administration is totally committed to defending U.S. citizens, U.S. businesses, and our nation’s constitutionally protected right of free speech. That is why the President made clear that the United States would respond proportionally to the DPRK’s attack on Sony Pictures, in a time and a manner of our choosing. Our response includes, as a first step, the Executive Order the President signed on January 2, which authorizes additional sanctions on designated agencies and officials of the DPRK government and Korean Worker’s Party. My colleagues and I want to talk more about these specific measures, but I also want to make clear that our response to the attack on Sony is consistent with our policy on the DPRK across the board – one which seeks to work with our allies and partners to increase the cost to North Korea of its irresponsible behavior, to sharpen the regime’s choices, and to persuade the DPRK peacefully to abandon its illicit nuclear weapons programs, respect the human rights of its people, and abide by international norms and obligations. Sadly, the cyber attack on Sony is nothing new for the DPRK. Its destructive, destabilizing, and repressive policies range from its ongoing violations of the UN Security Council resolutions covering its nuclear and missile programs, to its deplorable human rights conditions which the United Nations has strongly condemned. In the months before the Sony attack, the DPRK launched a series of ballistic missiles in violation of multiple UN Security Council resolutions; its Ocean Maritime Management Shipping Company was sanctioned by the Security Council for its illicit proliferation of weapons around the world; and it threatened a fourth nuclear test in response to a UN General Assembly resolution which condemned the gross, widespread, and systematic human rights abuses meticulously documented in a report by a UN Commission of Inquiry. Together with the international community, we are using the full range of tools at our disposal to make clear to the DPRK that abandoning this course and abiding by international laws and obligations is the only way to end its political and economic isolation. Diplomacy. Mr. Chairman, at the center of our efforts is our persistent, principled diplomacy with our partners in northeast Asia and around the world. The United States has offered – and continues to offer – Pyongyang an improved bilateral relationship provided it takes action to demonstrate a willingness to fulfill its denuclearization commitments and address other important concerns which are also shared by the international community. We seek credible and authentic negotiations to bring the DPRK into compliance with its denuclearization obligations. We have made clear to the DPRK that the door is open to meaningful engagement, while applying unilateral and multilateral pressure to steer it toward that door. Unfortunately, while North Korea claims to seek talks without preconditions, it has consistently rebuffed or ignored our offers for dialogue and instead responded with a series of provocations – from last summer’s ballistic missile launches to November’s attack on Sony. We know we must judge the DPRK by its actions, not its words. We remain open to engagement when possible, but we will continue to apply pressure as needed. Six-Party Diplomacy. Close coordination with North Korea’s neighbors, our partners in the Six-Party Talks – the Republic of Korea, Japan, China, and Russia – is essential. While the Six-Party Talks process has regrettably been dormant since the DPRK walked out and declared the process “dead” in 2008, our continued robust engagement with the other four parties has ensured that five-party unity has never been stronger on the common goal of the verifiable denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. This unity ensures that wherever Pyongyang turns, it hears a strong, unwavering message from all five parties – echoed by the wider international community – that it will not be accepted as a nuclear power, that it must live up to its international obligations, and that authentic and credible negotiations must be marked by concrete denuclearization steps. None of us insists that North Korea denuclearize before returning to the negotiating table. But we all refuse to be drawn into talks for the sake of talks. We have underscored the need for an early and demonstrable commitment from the DPRK to denuclearize. Instead, the DPRK has chosen to continue flouting the standards and obligations of the international community. ROK and Japan. Our alliances with Japan and the Republic of Korea are a bedrock of our Six-Party diplomacy. The President and Secretary Kerry speak regularly with their counterparts in Tokyo and Seoul, and this month I will travel to Japan for trilateral talks on North Korea with my South Korean and Japanese colleagues. The visit will mark my second trip to the region since assuming my current position just two months ago. Both allies are resolute in their commitment to the goal of the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and an end to North Korea’s illicit behavior. Our coordination has ensured that as South Korean President Park Geun-hye seeks to test Pyongyang’s professed interest in improving North-South ties and healing the wounds that have divided Korean families for 70 years, there is no daylight between Washington and Seoul on what we expect from North Korea. President Park has made clear that major improvements in inter-Korean relations can come only with denuclearization, and we hope the North will embrace her principled vision. Similarly, as Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe seeks the return of innocent Japanese citizens abducted by the DPRK and held for decades, Tokyo has made clear that real progress in the bilateral relationship comes only with denuclearization. In the weeks since establishing that the attack on Sony Pictures was launched by the DPRK, we have been in constant touch with both Japan and South Korea, and both governments have condemned the attack and expressed solidarity with the United States in our response. China. On my upcoming trip to Northeast Asia, I will also visit Beijing. China has a unique and important role to play in addressing the challenges of North Korea’s nuclear program and its provocations on the world stage. We believe there is more that China can do to bring the necessary pressure to bear so that North Korea concludes it has no choice but to denuclearize and abide by its international obligations. China has already done a great deal, and North Korea remains at the top of our bilateral agenda with China and featured prominently in the President’s discussions with Xi Jinping in Beijing last November. In their meeting, both leaders affirmed that North Korea cannot succeed in pursuing both nuclear weapons and economic development. It cannot have both. In the wake of the cyber attack against Sony Pictures, China has again sent a signal to its neighbor, condemning this type of malicious behavior in cyberspace. Russia. As our global cooperation with Moscow has been strained by Russia’s aggression in Ukraine, the DPRK has sought to reduce its economic dependence on China by pursuing stronger ties with Russia, and Russia has responded positively. Moscow has forgiven some of the DPRK’s debt, pursued investment in North Korea’s railroad network, and even invited Kim Jong Un to visit Moscow later this year But our alignment on the core goal of denuclearization remains as strong as ever. When senior Russian leaders have met with their North Korean counterparts, they have consistently delivered a tough message on denuclearization. As a major stakeholder in the international nonproliferation regime, Russia will remain an important player in our diplomacy with the DPRK. International Community. We also work actively with partners in the broader international community to reinforce to North Korea that its isolation will continue until its provocations cease. In the United Nations Security Council, we successfully led the charge to sanction the DPRK’s major international shipping firm for its role in the regime’s illicit arms trade. We have worked with partners from Australia to Southeast Asia to Africa to increase enforcement of UN sanctions and reduce the revenues the DPRK can funnel to its nuclear and missile programs. In the months since a UN Commission of Inquiry documented in disturbing detail North Korea’s dire human rights situation, we have worked closely with countries around the world to maintain attention on this issue. The UN Human Rights Council and General Assembly this past year adopted by overwhelming margins resolutions calling for accountability for North Korea’s human rights abuses. For the first time just last month, the DPRK’s grave human rights situation was taken up as a standing agenda item by the UN Security Council. This helps ensure continued Council attention on the egregious human rights situation in the North, and it reflects the international community’s concerns for the threat to international peace and security that these systematic and widespread violations represent. Our coordination with partners in Asia and Europe helped ensure that when North Korea’s foreign minister and party secretary traveled abroad on an attempted charm offensive last fall, they heard a chorus of calls for progress on human rights and denuclearization. And in recent weeks, our international partners have joined us in condemning the destructive and coercive cyber attack on Sony Pictures, in calling on the DPRK to cease such attacks, and in supporting a proportionate response. Pressure. And, in our messages to the DPRK and to our partners around the world, we have made clear that we will respond to the DPRK’s misbehavior. We are under no illusions about the DPRK’s willingness to abandon its illicit weapons, provocations, and human rights abuses on its own. We will apply pressure both multilaterally and unilaterally to increase the costs to the DPRK of its destructive policy choices. The New Executive Order. The Executive Order signed by the President on January 2 is an important new tool, enhancing our ability to apply pressure on Pyongyang. It responds to the attack on Sony Pictures, but also provides a framework for addressing the full range of DPRK illicit behavior going forward. In this initial tranche of sanctions issued under the Executive Order, our application of this Executive Order has been targeted. We seek to impose consequences on the wrongdoers in the DPRK regime, not on the North Korean people. We have designated the Reconnaissance General Bureau, the DPRK’s elite intelligence agency known to be responsible for many of its cyber operations, as well as its major arms dealer and missile technology procurement agency, and several of its overseas arms trade representatives. Designating these entities and individuals under this new Executive Order, in addition to their previous designations under nonproliferation-related authorities, not only highlights the DPRK’s violations of international norms and laws at a moment when the world’s eyes are on Pyongyang, but also – as my colleague from Treasury can discuss in greater detail – gives us the ability in the future to designate those who provide material support to these designees. This Executive Order is one aspect of our response to the cyber attack on Sony Pictures. My colleague from the Department of Homeland Security can elaborate on the measures the Administration is taking to shore up the cyber defenses for both the public and private sectors here at home. Multilateral Cooperation on Sanctions. With this expansion of sanctions, as with our existing sanctions authorities targeting the DPRK, we seek to increase the costs of North Korea’s misbehavior, reduce the revenues the DPRK is able to funnel to its illicit nuclear and ballistic missile programs, and sharpen the regime’s choices. In applying this pressure, just as in our efforts at engagement, our work with allies is critical. As I mentioned, we worked together with China, Russia, and other members of the UN Security Council to designate under UN sanctions North Korea’s Ocean Maritime Management shipping company, and we regularly work together with partners like Japan, South Korea, and Australia to improve sanctions implementation. We are currently briefing our partners on the authorities provided under the President’s latest Executive Order, as they continuously review their own sanctions programs. This approach – balancing the need to respond decisively to North Korea’s provocations with the need to enlist support from our allies and partners – is critical to the success of our sanctions regime. The United States has very limited economic and other ties with the DPRK, hence, our financial sanctions are always more effective when supported by and – when possible – implemented together with our partners. Deterrence. We also work with our allies to deter DPRK aggression. Having left Seoul as ambassador just a few months ago, I can tell you that our alliance with South Korea is stronger than ever. From our day-to-day combined efforts to maintain peace and stability on the Peninsula through our Combined Forces Command, to the counter-provocation and counter-missile planning our Department of Defense and Joint Staff colleagues engage in with their South Korean counterparts, we send a strong message to North Korea that security is not to be found in nuclear weapons and military provocations. Our growing trilateral security cooperation with South Korea and Japan also sends a powerful message of deterrence to Pyongyang. This was seen over the last year in our trilateral Search and Rescue Exercises, our July Chiefs of Defense meeting between Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Dempsey and his counterparts in Seoul and Tokyo, the June trilateral defense ministerial meeting led by Secretary Hagel, and my own periodic discussions with my Korean and Japanese counterparts. Other measures we have taken in the region to strengthen bilateral and trilateral missile defense cooperation are also tied to our larger diplomatic strategy of building and maintaining a strong diplomatic consensus against a nuclear-armed North Korea. This past December we concluded a trilateral arrangement between the United States, the ROK, and Japan which will enable the defense authorities of our three countries to share information on the nuclear and missile threats posed by North Korea. Conclusion. Ultimately, Mr. Chairman, our policy aims to bring the DPRK to the realization that it must take the steps necessary to end its isolation, respect the human rights of its own people, honor its past commitments, and comply with its international obligations. North Korea is not, as they claim, developing nuclear weapons and intercontinental ballistic missiles in response to a threat from the United States or any outside power. Rather, North Korea believes these programs will help prolong the Kim regime and obtain material and political benefits from the international community. By portraying the United States as a strategic enemy, the DPRK hopes to strengthen its narrative that the U.S. is responsible for North Korea’s bad behavior and, therefore, solely responsible for mitigating it. We are not. North Korea is responsible for North Korean actions. Standing up to North Korea requires a sustained and concerted effort by all of the countries in the Six-Party process, and indeed by the entire international community. The leadership in Pyongyang faces ever-sharper choices. Its isolation grows with every outrageous act it commits. North Korea will not achieve security, economic prosperity, and integration into the international community while pursuing nuclear weapons, trampling on international norms, abusing its own people, and using cyberspace to destroy the property of private businesses and threaten violence on Americans. Thank you again for the opportunity to appear before you today. I am happy to answer any questions you may have.

TITLE: As Prepared Remarks at Georgetown University Institute for Law, Science and Global Security's 2013 International Engagement on Cyber Conference

TEXT: It’s a pleasure to be here today. I want to begin by thanking Georgetown University and Professor Catherine Lotrionte for hosting us. My office has been fortunate to participate in this conference for the last few years, and it is simply remarkable—and a testament to Catherine’s thoughtful leadership—how this annual event has grown since it was first held in 2011. Last week, my office celebrated its third anniversary. It was an important milestone, and not only for my staff and me personally. When my office was set up three years ago, it was the first of its kind: an office dedicated to cyber diplomacy. The State Department recognized early on that this set of issues constituted a new foreign policy imperative. As we reached out to ask other states and nations to join us in working toward prosperity, security and openness in the cyber realm, the concept of cyber diplomacy was, at first, so new that we had to work hard to find counterparts in foreign governments to engage with. One indicator of how quickly cyber issues have shot to the forefront of diplomatic agendas is how completely this has changed. Now there are offices dedicated to cyber diplomacy in foreign ministries throughout the world, and new ones being set up every year. Cyber issues are being discussed at every major international forum, and cyber diplomacy is increasingly seen by all states as essential to the conduct of their foreign policy. A primary goal in the creation of the State Department’s Office of the Coordinator for Cyber Issues was to advance the objectives laid out in the White House International Strategy for Cyberspace, issued in May 2011. The International Strategy, the first of its kind in the world, articulates the U.S. vision of cyberspace as “a place where the norms of responsible, just, and peaceful conduct among states and people have begun to take hold,” and commits to “an international cyberspace policy that empowers the innovation that drives our economy and improves lives here and abroad.” Most important, the International Strategy reflects our conviction that if all the nations and peoples of the world are to reap the tremendous political, economic, and social benefits that cyberspace offers, cyberspace must be open, interoperable, secure, and reliable. This conviction is the basis for all our diplomatic efforts. Of course, not all states share our vision. Some states see the open Internet as a threat to their stability, and they have sought to assert sovereign rights to inappropriately control content online. And the events of the past year have posed additional challenges. The unauthorized NSA disclosures have led some states to seek changes to the global Internet architecture that could lead to a fragmented “splinternet.” Nonetheless, we think that the same fundamental cyber policy principles that were important before the disclosures remain important now. Our goal, now as when the International Strategy was released, is to work with that large community of like-minded governments and other stakeholders that support the notion of an open, interoperable, secure, and reliable Internet as the best way to reap the Internet’s economic and social benefits. The State Department is working to promote these principles in six areas: The first is international security in cyberspace. We continue to work to develop a shared understanding about norms of acceptable state behavior in cyberspace, which will help enhance stability, ground foreign and defense policies, guide international partnerships, and help prevent the misunderstandings that lead to conflict. Even with the challenges of the last year, there have been significant accomplishments in this area: The 2013 UN Group of Governmental Experts—a group of fifteen countries that included the United States, led by my deputy, Michele Markoff, as well as countries like Russia and China—reached a landmark consensus that the same international legal principles, such as the UN Charter and the law of state responsibility, that have promoted predictability and stability between states during conflict in the kinetic space apply equally in cyberspace. At the next UNGGE beginning in July, we will build on this important agreement and look more closely at how international law applies to state-on-state conduct in cyberspace. We will also seek to build agreement on additional norms of responsible state behavior, grounded in existing international law, that apply to the spectrum of cyber activity that falls below the use-of-force threshold. The US has also led international efforts to establish practical cyber risk reduction and confidence building measures. We have worked through bilateral engagements toward reaching agreements on CBMS, designed to reduce the risk of escalation due to misunderstanding or miscalculation regarding a cyber incident of national security concern emanating from U.S. or another country’s territory. And in December, at the ministerial of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, we achieved an agreement among the 57 participating states for the first ever cyber CBMs for a multinational security organization. These measures seek to enhance interstate cooperation, transparency, predictability, and stability. Over the coming year at the OSCE we will work with the participating states to implement these initial CBMs while also developing additional cooperative measures. And we are also leading the development of cyber CBMs in other regional organizations, such as the ASEAN Regional Forum. We envision a future of greater stability and cooperation where all states are connected through these risk-reduction measures. The second area where we work is Internet Governance. This is the emerging front in the struggle for openness in cyberspace. The United States and many others in the international community support the existing, inclusive multistakeholder model of Internet governance. Other states seek to establish intergovernmental oversight mechanisms for the technical management of Internet resources and operations. The politics of intergovernmental control would upend the currently successful model of governance, leaving non-governmental stakeholders disenfranchised. Any mechanism involving total government control over Internet policy would inevitably enshrine restrictive rules and regulations and help legitimize the kind of censorship and content control exercised by repressive regimes. The United States opposes these efforts to shift Internet governance to a top-down, intergovernmental model. As part of our efforts, we are working to promote more diverse representation by governments and other stakeholders at multi-stakeholder institutions, building multi-stakeholder capacity to participate in the process, and supporting efforts to further internationalize governance functions. We have also successfully opposed efforts to create a top-down, state-driven, UN-style mechanism for Internet management in venues like the ITU. The third area is promoting Internet Freedom. In the past years, threats to internet freedom have grown, as a look at some of the independent reports out there, like those written by Freedom House or Reporters without Borders, clearly show. In fact, according to data from the OpenNet Initiative, 960 million Internet users live in countries that impose illegitimate restrictions on content—that’s 47% of all Internet users. For this reason, it is more important than ever that the U.S. Government continues work to ensure the ability of individuals worldwide to exercise their fundamental freedoms online. This involves: (1) promoting the existing consensus that international human rights obligations and commitments apply to online activity; (2) providing support for individuals facing repression online and bolstering civil society roles in Internet policymaking processes; and (3) encouraging companies to adopt practices and policies that respect human rights online. I am happy to say that we have had some important successes in recent years. We were part of the core group of supporters of the 2012 UN Human Rights Council resolution 20/8, which affirmed that the rights that people have offline also apply online. The resolution was adopted by consensus and is now the clearest statement from the world’s governments in support of Internet freedom. In addition, we were instrumental in the launch of the Freedom Online Coalition in 2011. This is a group of governments committed to taking concrete action in support of Internet freedom. The group has organized annual conferences to discuss pressing issues, and it also serves as a vehicle for coordinating efforts at international venues where there might be Internet Freedom implications. And the group is continuing to grow; since its launch it has expanded to include 21 governments, from all regions of the world. The fourth area is combating the serious threat posed by the explosion in cybercrime, a topic near and dear to me from my previous life as a criminal prosecutor with the Department of Justice. Cybercrime is a metastasizing transnational scourge that has cost the global economy, by some estimates, billions of dollars, and has reduced public trust in the Internet. Some states believe that the answer to the cybercrime phenomena is to promote a new UN treaty, which would take years to negotiate, be unlikely to result in anything of greater utility than the Budapest Cybercrime Convention to which the U.S. and forty other countries are parties, and potentially sideline many ongoing and effective efforts to build international capacity to tackle high-tech crime. We believe the Budapest Convention provides a strong basis for our fight against cybercrime, while also protecting fundamental human rights. It identifies the three elements needed for effective cybercrime legislation, namely: (1) strong and harmonious substantive cybercrime laws; (2) comprehensive investigative tools for addressing high-tech crime and conducting digital forensics; and (3) effective mechanisms for both formal and informal international cooperation, like the G-8 24/7 Network. Diplomatically, promoting accession to the Budapest Convention and participation in the G-8 24/7 Network is a key priority for the U.S. We are heartened to see regionally diverse countries like Japan, Australia, the Dominican Republic and Mauritius becoming parties to the Convention in the last two years, with many more countries – including Senegal, Colombia, Costa Rica, Morocco and Israel in the process of joining. But we also recognize that many countries need help with this fight, and so we are strongly supporting capacity building efforts to enhance states’ ability to fight cybercrime and address the exponential growth in digital evidence in all criminal investigations. The State Department is working with our interagency partners such as the Departments of Justice and Commerce, as well as the private sector and key international partners and institutions to eliminate cybercrime havens wherever they may exist. We firmly believe that the battle against transnational cybercrime is one we can and will win. The fifth area is ensuring that nations perform their cybersecurity due diligence. Here, working closely with DHS as well as the rest of the interagency, we are strengthening relationships with other countries as we cooperate on cybersecurity issues of mutual concern. This includes efforts to enhance collaboration on network defense, incident management and recovery, and supporting the development of those capabilities where needed. It also involves enhancing participation in and strengthening of existing regional and global cybersecurity fora. For example, the U.S. Government has provided a number of regional capacity building trainings to countries in eastern and western Africa in the last few years, and we plan to do more such trainings in the future. We use our diplomatic engagements and other channels to emphasize the importance of good cybersecurity due diligence in our shared goals of a more secure and reliable cyberspace. The State Department has been a big supporter of greater international CERT-to-CERT cooperation and CERT experts are often a part of our international delegations. We also use our diplomatic channels to support DHS information sharing efforts, helping to draw the attention of foreign policy makers to the need for cooperation on specific cybersecurity threats of serious concern. The final area is State’s work to promote the Internet, and cyberspace more generally, as an engine of economic growth. The Internet has proven to be a major catalyst for economic development around the world. The State Department is supporting efforts to bridge the digital divide so that an open, interoperable, secure and reliable Internet can be an engine for growth in even the poorest regions of the world. The State Department has provided support both through its diplomatic efforts and its support for the Alliance for Affordable Internet, a coordinated public-private-civil society voice advocating policy and regulatory best practices for expanding affordable access to the Internet. Moreover, USAID has also taken a lead in providing technical assistance and capacity building through its Global Broadband and Innovation Program and through its Mobile Solutions team in the Global Development Lab. So, as I look back on the last three busy and at times challenging years, I feel comfortable that the U.S. Government is promoting the right vision for the future of cyber issues—one that like-minded countries around the world agree with, and one that will make the benefits of cyberspace—as we in the U.S. are fortunate enough to enjoy them right now—available to more and more of the people of the world. As we tackle the many opportunities that lie ahead, our commitment to the principles laid out in the International Strategy is one constant. The other constant is also articulated in the International Strategy, which notes that “international collaboration is more than a best practice; it is a first principle.”

TITLE: Remarks at High Level Leader's Meeting

TEXT: Good morning, Minister, Chairman Sasongko, Mr. Assistant Secretary General [UNDESA], and Mr. President [ICANN], distinguished colleagues and participants here today. It is truly a pleasure to join you all in beautiful Bali, and an honor to take part in this Leader’s Meeting today. As this important meeting immediately precedes the Internet Governance Forum starting here in Bali tomorrow, we appreciate the adjacency of the two related but distinct meetings in order to take the opportunity of the gathering of people from countries all over the world for this more targeted yet equally robust conversation. We have quite a full agenda for this meeting, so I will focus my remarks this morning on two key areas on which we in the United States are heavily engaged under the meeting’s theme of Global Multi-stakeholder Collaboration and that address some of the sub-themes for our dialogue today. First, allow me to introduce my colleague Ambassador Danny Sepulveda, our new Ambassador for Communications and Information Policy who will be joining our discussion today and those in the IGF throughout the week. Other members of the U.S. Government are also in attendance, along with industry and civil society representatives. Second, I should mention that I come to Bali directly from Seoul, South Korea, where I led the U.S. delegation to the third installment of the Cyber Conference series was just held. Launched in London two years ago and followed by Hungary last year, the conference continued its focus on cybersecurity, international security, cybercrime, economic growth, and social benefits. This year's event added an emphasis on cyber capacity building, giving that issue increased prominence. The Korean hosts also welcomed more stakeholders from developing nations than ever before to the Conference, enriching the discussion generally, and adding an extra dimension to consideration of capacity building approaches. Many of the topics discussed in Seoul are equally pertinent here, and the Seoul Framework for and Commitment to an Open and Secure Cyberspace lays out a valuable set of existing, pertinent principles that I commend for your reference. The sub-themes laid out for this discussion reflect the breadth, diversity, and complexity of cyber issues. It’s not possible to address all of these issues in the short time we have here. As the first key area, I will focus on the progress in the last year or so in the pursuit of international consensus on principles that should guide us as we think about these many issues. The U.S. regards cyberspace as something that is neither owned nor controlled by states. We see states as one of many stewards working to ensure that this resource is available to all the world’s people. Yet, in the cyber realm, as elsewhere, states have a special responsibility, working with all stakeholders, both to protect their own national security and to promote peaceful and stable relations between themselves and other nations. Because state-on-state actions in cyberspace have the potential to disrupt cyber-dependent economies and damage critical national infrastructure, it is essential that states promote transnational cooperation in order to keep the peace in cyberspace. Some years ago the US concluded that the international community needed to strive for a state of "international cyber stability"; an environment where all states are able to positively and dependably exploit the benefits of cyberspace; where there are benefits to cooperation and to avoiding conflict and little incentive for states to disrupt one another’s computer networks or Internet activity. We believe that the appropriate framework to achieve this stability is through recognition of international norms, and confidence building measures. The framework of existing international law and norms of acceptable state behavior which guide states in other contexts must also apply to cyberspace. Along with norms, the United States believes that practical operational confidence building measures are needed to enhance predictability and reduce the risk of conflict. On June 7 of this year, in the context of a UN Group of Governmental Experts, 15 states including our hosts and many other states here today - achieved a ground-breaking consensus report. The Group: Agreed that confidence-building measures, such as high-level communication and timely information sharing, can enhance trust and assurance among states and help reduce the risk of conflict by increasing predictability and reducing misperception. Agreed on the vital importance of capacity-building to enhance global cooperation in securing cyberspace. Affirmed that state efforts to address the security of ICTs must go hand in hand with respect for human rights and fundamential freedoms set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international instruments. Reaffirmed the importance of an open and accessible cyberspace, as it enables economic and social development. Agreed that the combination of all these efforts support a more secure cyberspace. Perhaps the most significant single achievement in this consensus was the Group’s affirmation that international law applies in cyberspace. That affirmation was coupled with consensus that States must meet their international obligations regarding internationally wrongful acts attributable to them; States must not use proxies to commit internationally wrongful acts; and states should seek to ensure that their territories are not used by non-State actors for unlawful use of ICTs. It is our expectation that future discussions on these subjects will use the results of this report as the foundation for discussion on how international law applies in cyberspace, how the international community can work with developing states to improve their own capacity, and how to implement specific practical measures to achieve these goals. The U.S. believes that broad recognition of norms will help promote a safer and more secure cyberspace. In particular, the understanding that International law applies on the Internet is helpful for discussions around the second key area – the topic of Cyber Ethics. For the United States, discussions about cyber ethics must begin with the fundamental understanding that human rights apply equally online as they do offline. This principle has been widely recognized by the international community. In fact, the UN Human Rights Council affirmed this principle by consensus just last year. So, further conversations on this topic need to begin by acknowledging the human rights obligations and commitments we each have. Notably, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights does not limit the protections given for expression only to what is termed “ethical” expression. In contrast, some states seek to define “ethical standards” to suppress speech they do not agree with. We stress that human rights are universal, and do not vary from place to place, or from culture to culture. Some view network technologies like the Internet as disruptive. But, when the State curtails freedom of expression online in the interests of social stability, they limit their future development. Their young people miss out on conversations and debates elsewhere in the world, and they lack exposure to the free inquiry that spurs people to question old ways of doing business and invent new ones. Freedom of thought is part of what fuels economic innovation. In the United States, the ability of citizens to exercise their right to freedom of expression has paid big dividends. There is a clear connection between our freedom to express our thoughts and our ability to organize our companies and our societies in creative and innovative ways that make us more productive, more efficient, and more prosperous. In conclusion, there has been significant progress in forging international consensus on the issues under discussion today. The United States will continue to work toward regional and international collaboration on key cyberspace activities, including norms, and also areas where capacity building, multi-stakeholderism, and trust can contribute to greater international cyber stability, growth, and sustainable development. Thank you for the opportunity to join this meeting today, and I look forward to the discussion.

TITLE: Cyber Security: Project Cyber Monday 3 and Project Transatlantic. ICE/EUROPOL Collaboration Successfully Targets and International Websites Selling Counterfeign Merchandise

TEXT: MODERATOR: Good afternoon, everyone. The Foreign Press Center is pleased to host a briefing on recent cyber security operations with Mr. John Morton. Mr. Morton has served as director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement since May of 2009. ICE is the principal investigative arm of the Department of Homeland Security and the second largest investigative agency in the federal government. Following the briefing, we’ll have time for a few questions, just a few. For those with me here, I would ask you to wait for the microphone before asking your question and identify yourselves as well as your outlet before you ask your question. And we’ll be also fielding some questions potentially from New York, by email, as well as overseas. With that, I will turn the floor to Director Morton. MR. MORTON: All right. Well, good day and welcome. I am John Morton, the Director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. And today I’m pleased to announce the results of a coordinated effort to attack online counterfeiting and consumer fraud on this Cyber Monday. Last year Cyber Monday generated a record $1.25 billion in sales, and we anticipate a similarly high level this year. The purpose of our efforts is to confront consumer fraud online. Organized criminals are using the internet and the holiday shopping season to defraud consumers on a grand scale. A wide variety of consumer goods are presented on bogus websites as being genuine, when in fact they are counterfeits, illegally produced and shipped from overseas. In this, our third year of attacking online counterfeiters on Cyber Monday, we have seized 101 websites here in the United States that were selling counterfeit and falsely labeled goods to consumers during the holiday season. These websites sold products representing 41 different rights holders of U.S. companies, everything from Ergo baby carriers to New Era hats, Nike sneakers, Tiffany jewelry, Oakley sunglasses, and NFL jerseys just to name a few. Even counterfeit Adobe software was for sale. This year we went a step further, taking this operation to both sides of the Atlantic. The National Intellectual Property Rights Coordination Center, a component of ICE’s Homeland Security investigations, partnered with our friends at Europol to coordinate seizures of counterfeit websites operating through top-level domain names in Europe such as .eu and .de. So today, Europol and its partner countries through Project Transatlantic seized an additional 31 domain names. Law enforcement agencies from Belgium and the United Kingdom took part in this coordinated effort, and other Europol partners will be participating in the coming days with additional websites being addressed. For the specifics, you have the Belgian Federal Police obtaining warrants to seize 12 .eu domain names and one .de domain name and the City of London Police redirecting the domain names of an additional 18 websites. We are, in short, organizing a transnational law enforcement effort to defeat transnational criminal organizations, a united front against a common foe. Domain names such as hermesborse.eu and nikeatalon.eu were selling everything from counterfeit Hermes purses, Christian Louboutin shoes, and various Nike apparel, all of it fake, all of it substandard. Between both of these operations on both sides of the Atlantic, we have seized a total of 132 websites. These websites were stealing from businesses, trademark and copyright holders, and the people who make the legitimate products and who sell them, including companies here and abroad. This is a global problem. It affects everyone. When IP rights are violated, jobs are lost, businesses are stolen, and ultimately consumers are cheated. Remember, counterfeiters care about making money and only about making money. They don’t pay healthcare, they don’t pay pensions, they don’t pay taxes, they don’t care about the people that work for them, and they don’t, frankly, care about the consumers who purchase the products. Recognizing the Cyber Monday is the busiest day for online purchases in the United States, we’ve conducted specific operations around this day to try to bring more awareness to the public about the potential dangers of shopping online. Shoppers all over the world are continuing to make purchases online in increasing numbers. That’s a good thing. The internet is a good thing. Sales over the internet are a good thing. But with an increase in online shopping comes an increase, sadly, in online predators, organized criminals looking to take advantage of unsuspecting consumers to make a quick buck. Unfortunately, counterfeiters have expanded from selling DVDs and purses to products that affect the health and safety of consumers, everything from counterfeit pharmaceuticals, counterfeit heart medicine, for example, to counterfeit airbags. For example, in this operation, counterfeiters were offering Ergo baby carriers for sale on many websites. Were these legitimate baby carriers? No. They were 100 percent knockoffs having nothing to do with Ergo Baby, having nothing to do with thoughtful design. Were they safe? Absolutely not. This is a purchase that expectant parents should not have to worry about. And in many instances, the websites were designed to mimic the real Ergo baby carrier site to further dupe consumers. If you go to our Facebook page, you can see an example of that and the increasing sophistication that counterfeiters are using to attract consumers to dupe them, to rip them off. This is a fraud from start to finish. If you go on the Facebook site, I invite you, you try to see if you can determine the difference between the real sites and the legitimate sites, and you’ll find you’ll have a very, very hard time doing it. Visitors to the domain names that we have taken will now find a banner that notifies them of the seizure and educates them about the federal crime of trademark and copyright infringement. And these seizures underscore the lessons of online shopping for all of us at this time of the holidays. Remember, if the price seems too good to be true, it probably is. Know your supplier, know your seller, research the seller or the website from which you intend to make a purchase, look at all of the web pages. If you see misspellings, if you see addresses on a site that pretends to be about Tiffany, but the return policy addresses is used some place in China, well you’re on notice that trouble is afoot. Educate yourself on the exact logo, the hardware, and the stitching of whatever you’re considering to make sure that you’re getting what you think you’re getting. Don’t conduct business with an anonymous user. I’ll tell you, a number of these websites are frauds through and through. Not only are they looking to defraud you in terms of what you buy, often providing them your credit card number is not a good idea either, and there are numerous instances of more than one crime going on these websites. At the end of the day, trust your instincts. You know what you’re looking for, you know the product, you know when a site is likely legitimate. This is the best line of defense for you, so don’t reason away your intuition. And I just think, in closing, people need to realize that obviously the holidays are a time of great excitement for all of us, and when you go out there and you try to buy the real thing for your relative or your family member, you want it to be legitimate, you’re paying for it, and unfortunately there is a steady group of organized criminals that are trying to rip you off, literally, from start to finish. And that’s what this enforcement action was all about, and for the first time we’re doing it together with the Europeans, the right answer. This is a global problem; this isn’t a U.S. problem, it’s not a European problem, it’s not a Mexican problem. It’s a shared problem that we need to handle all together.

TITLE: Video Remarks for the Budapest Cyber Conference

TEXT: I am delighted to be able to send greetings to all of you as you come together to tackle the full range of cyber policy issues. As I said last year when we launched our International Strategy for Cyberspace, the issues you’re working on represent a new foreign policy imperative for the United States. That’s why we are building  an environment in which norms of responsible behavior guide states’ actions, sustain partnerships, and support the rule of law in cyberspace. Within the last six months, the United States has launched new whole-of-government cyber dialogues with Brazil, India, South Africa, and many of our closest allies and like-minded partners. We have also had productive conversations with Russia and China, and we are working with key international and multilateral partners to find common ground; and we are supporting capacity building in the developing world by partnering with allies to deliver a range of programs. I am particularly pleased that you will be examining how nongovernmental actors can help harness the power of the internet to promote more inclusive government and greater democratic values. As you look for new solutions and continue these conversations from Budapest to Seoul and beyond, consider the United States a partner every step of the way.

TITLE: International Law in Cyberspace

TEXT: Thank you, Colonel Brown, for your kind invitation to speak here today at this very important conference on “the roles of cyber in national defense.” I have been an international lawyer for more than thirty years, a government lawyer practicing international law for more than a decade, and the State Department’s Legal Adviser for nearly 3 ½ years. While my daily workload covers many of the bread and butter issues of international law—diplomatic immunity, the law of the sea, international humanitarian law, treaty interpretation—like many of you, I find more and more of my time is spent grappling with the question of how international law applies in cyberspace. Everyone here knows that cyberspace presents new opportunities and new challenges for the United States in every foreign policy realm, including national defense. But for international lawyers, it also presents cutting-edge issues of international law, which go to a very fundamental question: how do we apply old laws of war to new cyber-circumstances, staying faithful to enduring principles, while accounting for changing times and technologies? Many, many international lawyers here in the U.S. Government and around the world have struggled with this question, so today I’d like to present an overview of how we in the U.S. Government have gone about meeting this challenge. At the outset, let me highlight that the entire endeavor of applying established international law to cyberspace is part of a broader international conversation. We are not alone in thinking about these questions; we are actively engaged with the rest of the international community, both bilaterally and multilaterally, on the subject of applying international law in cyberspace. With your permission, I’d like to offer a series of questions and answers that illuminate where we are right now – in a place where we’ve made remarkable headway in a relatively short period of time, but are still finding new questions for each and every one we answer. In fact, the U.S. Government has been regularly sharing these thoughts with our international partners. Most of the points that follow we have not just agreed upon internally, but made diplomatically, in our submissions to the UN Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) that deals with information technology issues. I. International Law in Cyberspace: What We Know. Wo let me start with the most fundamental questions: Question 1: Do established principles of international law apply to cyberspace? Answer 1: Yes, international law principles do apply in cyberspace. Everyone here knows how cyberspace opens up a host of novel and extremely difficult legal issues. But on this key question, this answer has been apparent, at least as far as the U.S. Government has been concerned. Significantly, this view has not necessarily been universal in the international community. At least one country has questioned whether existing bodies of international law apply to the cutting edge issues presented by the internet. Some have also said that existing international law is not up to the task, and that we need entirely new treaties to impose a unique set of rules on cyberspace. But the United States has made clear our view that established principles of international law do apply in cyberspace. Question 2: Is cyberspace a law-free zone, where anything goes? Answer 2: Emphatically no. Cyberspace is not a “law-free” zone where anyone can conduct hostile activities without rules or restraint. Think of it this way. This is not the first time that technology has changed and that international law has been asked to deal with those changes. In particular, because the tools of conflict are constantly evolving, one relevant body of law – international humanitarian law, or the law of armed conflict – affirmatively anticipates technological innovation, and contemplates that its existing rules will apply to such innovation. To be sure, new technologies raise new issues and thus, new questions. Many of us in this room have struggled with such questions, and we will continue to do so over many years. But to those who say that established law is not up to the task, we must articulate and build consensus around how it applies and reassess from there whether and what additional understandings are needed. Developing common understandings about how these rules apply in the context of cyberactivities in armed conflict will promote stability in this area. That consensus-building work brings me to some questions and answers we have offered to our international partners to explain how both the law of going to war (jus ad bellum) and the laws that apply in conducting war (jus in bello) apply to cyberaction: Question 3: Do cyber activities ever constitute a use of force? Answer 3: Yes. Cyber activities may in certain circumstances constitute uses of force within the meaning of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter and customary international law. In analyzing whether a cyber operation would constitute a use of force, most commentators focus on whether the direct physical injury and property damage resulting from the cyber event looks like that which would be considered a use of force if produced by kinetic weapons. Cyber activities that proximately result in death, injury, or significant destruction would likely be viewed as a use of force. In assessing whether an event constituted a use of force in or through cyberspace, we must evaluate factors: including the context of the event, the actor perpetrating the action (recognizing challenging issues of attribution in cyberspace), the target and location, effects and intent, among other possible issues. Commonly cited examples of cyber activity that would constitute a use of force include, for example: (1) operations that trigger a nuclear plant meltdown; (2) operations that open a dam above a populated area causing destruction; or (3) operations that disable air traffic control resulting in airplane crashes. Only a moment’s reflection makes you realize that this is common sense: if the physical consequences of a cyber attack work the kind of physical damage that dropping a bomb or firing a missile would, that cyber attack should equally be considered a use of force. Question 4: May a State ever respond to a computer network attack by exercising a right of national self-defense? Answer 4: Yes. A State’s national right of self-defense, recognized in Article 51 of the UN Charter, may be triggered by computer network activities that amount to an armed attack or imminent threat thereof. As the United States affirmed in its 2011 International Strategy for Cyberspace, “when warranted, the United States will respond to hostile acts in cyberspace as we would to any other threat to our country.” Question 5: Do jus in bello rules apply to computer network attacks? Answer 5: Yes. In the context of an armed conflict, the law of armed conflict applies to regulate the use of cyber tools in hostilities, just as it does other tools. The principles of necessity and proportionality limit uses of force in self-defense and would regulate what may constitute a lawful response under the circumstances. There is no legal requirement that the response to a cyber armed attack take the form of a cyber action, as long as the response meets the requirements of necessity and proportionality. Question 6: Must attacks distinguish between military and nonmilitary objectives? Answer 6: Yes. The jus in bello principle of distinction applies to computer network attacks undertaken in the context of an armed conflict. The principle of distinction applies to cyber activities that amount to an “attack” – as that term is understood in the law of war – in the context of an armed conflict. As in any form of armed conflict, the principle of distinction requires that the intended effect of the attack must be to harm a legitimate military target. We must distinguish military objectives – that is, objects that make an effective contribution to military action and whose destruction would offer a military advantage – from civilian objects, which under international law are generally protected from attack. Question 7: Must attacks adhere to the principle of proportionality? Answer 7: Yes. The jus in bello principle of proportionality applies to computer network attacks undertaken in the context of an armed conflict. The principle of proportionality prohibits attacks that may be expected to cause incidental loss to civilian life, injury to civilians, or damage to civilian objects that would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated. Parties to an armed conflict must assess what the expected harm to civilians is likely to be, and weigh the risk of such collateral damage against the importance of the expected military advantage to be gained. In the cyber context, this rule requires parties to a conflict to assess: (1) the effects of cyber weapons on both military and civilian infrastructure and users, including shared physical infrastructure (such as a dam or a power grid) that would affect civilians; (2) the potential physical damage that a cyber attack may cause, such as death or injury that may result from effects on critical infrastructure; and (3) the potential effects of a cyber attack on civilian objects that are not military objectives, such as private, civilian computers that hold no military significance, but may be networked to computers that are military objectives. Question 8: How should States assess their cyber weapons? Answer 8: States should undertake a legal review of weapons, including those that employ a cyber capability. Such a review should entail an analysis, for example, of whether a particular capability would be inherently indiscriminate, i.e., that it could not be used consistent with the principles of distinction and proportionality. The U.S. Government undertakes at least two stages of legal review of the use of weapons in the context of armed conflict – first, an evaluation of new weapons to determine whether their use would be per se prohibited by the law of war; and second, specific operations employing weapons are always reviewed to ensure that each particular operation is also compliant with the law of war. Question 9: In this analysis, what role does State sovereignty play? Answer 9: States conducting activities in cyberspace must take into account the sovereignty of other States, including outside the context of armed conflict. The physical infrastructure that supports the internet and cyber activities is generally located in sovereign territory and subject to the jurisdiction of the territorial State. Because of the interconnected, interoperable nature of cyberspace, operations targeting networked information infrastructures in one country may create effects in another country. Whenever a State contemplates conducting activities in cyberspace, the sovereignty of other States needs to be considered. Question 10: Are States responsible when cyber acts are undertaken through proxies? Answer 10: Yes. States are legally responsible for activities undertaken through “proxy actors,” who act on the State’s instructions or under its direction or control. The ability to mask one’s identity and geography in cyberspace and the resulting difficulties of timely, high-confidence attribution can create significant challenges for States in identifying, evaluating, and accurately responding to threats. But putting attribution problems aside for a moment, established international law does address the question of proxy actors. States are legally responsible for activities undertaken through putatively private actors, who act on the State’s instructions or under its direction or control. If a State exercises a sufficient degree of control over an ostensibly private person or group of persons committing an internationally wrongful act, the State assumes responsibility for the act, just as if official agents of the State itself had committed it. These rules are designed to ensure that States cannot hide behind putatively private actors to engage in conduct that is internationally wrongful. II. International Law in Cyberspace: Challenges and Uncertainties. These ten answers should give you a sense of how far we have come in doing what any good international lawyer does: applying established law to new facts, and explaining our positions to other interested lawyers. At the same time, there are obviously many more issues where the questions remain under discussion. Let me identify three particularly difficult questions that I don’t intend to answer here today. Instead, my hope is to shed some light on some of the cutting-edge legal issues that we’ll all be facing together over the next few years: Unresolved Question 1: How can a use of force regime take into account all of the novel kinds of effects that States can produce through the click of a button? As I said above, the United States has affirmed that established jus ad bellum rules do apply to uses of force in cyberspace. I have also noted some clear-cut cases where the physical effects of a hostile cyber action would be comparable to what a kinetic action could achieve: for example, a bomb might break a dam and flood a civilian population, but insertion of a line of malicious code from a distant computer might just as easily achieve that same result. As you all know, however, there are other types of cyber actions that do not have a clear kinetic parallel, which raise profound questions about exactly what we mean by “force.” At the same time, the difficulty of reaching a definitive legal conclusion or consensus among States on when and under what circumstances a hostile cyber action would constitute an armed attack does not automatically suggest that we need an entirely new legal framework specific to cyberspace. Outside of the cyber-context, such ambiguities and differences of view have long existed among States. To cite just one example of this, the United States has for a long time taken the position that the inherent right of self-defense potentially applies against any illegal use of force. In our view, there is no threshold for a use of deadly force to qualify as an “armed attack” that may warrant a forcible response. But that is not to say that any illegal use of force triggers the right to use any and all force in response – such responses must still be necessary and of course proportionate. We recognize, on the other hand, that some other countries and commentators have drawn a distinction between the “use of force” and an “armed attack,” and view “armed attack” – triggering the right to self-defense – as a subset of uses of force, which passes a higher threshold of gravity. My point here is not to rehash old debates, but to illustrate that States have long had to sort through complicated jus ad bellum questions. In this respect, the existence of complicated cyber questions relating to jus ad bellum is not in itself a new development; it is just applying old questions to the latest developments in technology. Unresolved Question 2: What do we do about “dual-use infrastructure” in cyberspace? As you all know, information and communications infrastructure is often shared between State militaries and private, civilian communities. The law of war requires that civilian infrastructure not be used to seek to immunize military objectives from attack, including in the cyber realm. But how, exactly, are the jus in bello rules to be implemented in cyberspace? Parties to an armed conflict will need to assess the potential effects of a cyber attack on computers that are not military objectives, such as private, civilian computers that hold no military significance, but may be networked to computers that are valid military objectives. Parties will also need to consider the harm to the civilian uses of such infrastructure in performing the necessary proportionality review. Any number of factual scenarios could arise, however, which will require a careful, fact-intensive legal analysis in each situation. Unresolved Question 3: How do we address the problem of attribution in cyberspace? As I mentioned earlier, cyberspace significantly increases an actor’s ability to engage in attacks with “plausible deniability,” by acting through proxies. I noted that legal tools exist to ensure that States are held accountable for those acts. What I want to highlight here is that many of these challenges – in particular, those concerning attribution – are as much questions of a technical and policy nature rather than exclusively or even predominantly questions of law. Cyberspace remains a new and dynamic operating environment, and we cannot expect that all answers to the new and confounding questions we face will be legal ones. These questions about effects, dual use, and attribution are difficult legal and policy questions that existed long before the development of cyber tools, and that will continue to be a topic of discussion among our allies and partners as cyber tools develop. Of course, there remain many other difficult and important questions about the application of international law to activities in cyberspace – for example, about the implications of sovereignty and neutrality law, enforcement mechanisms, and the obligations of States concerning “hacktivists” operating from within their territory. While these are not questions that I can address in this brief speech, they are critically important questions on which international lawyers will focus intensely in the years to come. And just as cyberspace presents challenging new issues for lawyers, it presents challenging new technical and policy issues. Not all of the issues I’ve mentioned are susceptible to clear legal answers derived from existing precedents – in many cases, quite the contrary. Answering these tough questions within the framework of existing law, consistent with our values and accounting for the legitimate needs of national security, will require a constant dialogue between lawyers, operators, and policymakers. All that we as lawyers can do is to apply in the cyber context the same rigorous approach to these hard questions that arise in the future, as we apply every day to what might be considered more traditional forms of conflict. III. The Role of International Law in a “Smart Power” Approach to Cyberspace. This, in a nutshell, is where we are with regard to cyberconflict: We have begun work to build consensus on a number of answers, but questions continue to arise that must be answered in the months and years ahead. Beyond these questions and answers and unresolved questions, though, lies a much bigger picture, one that we are very focused on at the State Department. Which brings me to my final two questions: Final Question 1: Is international humanitarian law the only body of international law that applies in cyberspace? Final Answer 1: No. As important as international humanitarian law is, it is not the only international law that applies in cyberspace. Obviously, cyberspace has become pervasive in our lives, not just in the national defense arena, but also through social media, publishing and broadcasting, expressions of human rights, and expansion of international commerce, both through online markets and online commercial techniques. Many other bodies of international and national law address those activities, and how those different bodies of law overlap and interact with the laws of cyber conflict is something we will all have to work out over time. Take human rights. At the same time that cyber activity can pose a threat, we all understand that cyber-communication is increasingly becoming a dominant mode of expression in the 21st century. More and more people express their views not by speaking on a soap box at Speakers’ Corner, but by blogging, tweeting, commenting, or posting videos and commentaries. The 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) – adopted more than 70 years ago – was remarkably forward-looking in anticipating these trends. It says: “Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.” (emphasis added) In short, all human beings are entitled to certain rights, whether they choose to exercise them in a city square or an internet chat room. This principle is an important part of our global diplomacy, and is encapsulated in the Internet Freedom agenda about which my boss, Secretary Clinton, has spoken so passionately. You all know of this Administration’s efforts not just in the areas of cyberconflict, but also in many other cyber areas: cybersecurity, cybercommerce, fighting child pornography and other forms of cybercrime. stopping intellectual property piracy, as well as promoting free expression and human rights. So the cyberconflict issues with which this group grapples do not constitute the whole of our approach to cyberspace; they are an important part – but only a part –of this Administration’s broader “smart power” approach to cyberspace. What I have outlined today are a series of answers to cyberspace questions that the United States is on the record as supporting. I have also suggested a few of the challenging questions that remain before us, and developments over the next decade will surely produce new questions. But you should not think of these questions and answers as just a box to check before deciding whether a particular proposed operation is lawful or not. Rather, these questions and answers are part of a much broader foreign policy agenda, which transpires in a broader framework of respect for international law. That leads to my Final Question for this group: Why should U.S Government lawyers care about international law in cyberspace at all? The Answer: Because compliance with international law frees us to do more, and do more legitimately, in cyberspace, in a way that more fully promotes our national interests. Compliance with international law in cyberspace is part and parcel of our broader “smart power” approach to international law as part of U.S. foreign policy. It is worth noting two fundamentally different philosophies about international law. One way to think about law, whether domestic or international, is as a straitjacket, a pure constraint. This approach posits that nations have serious, legitimate interests, and legal regimes restrict their ability to carry them out. One consequence of this view is that, since law is just something that constrains, it should be resisted whenever possible. Resisting so-called “extensions” of the law to new areas often seems attractive: because, after all, the old laws weren’t built for these new challenges anyway, some say, so we should tackle those challenges without the legal straitjacket, while leaving the old laws behind. But that is not the United States Government’s view of the law, domestic or international. We see law not as a straitjacket, but as one great university calls it when it confers its diplomas, a body of “wise restraints that make us free.” International law is not purely constraint, it frees us and empowers us to do things we could never do without law’s legitimacy. If we succeed in promoting a culture of compliance, we will reap the benefits. And if we earn a reputation for compliance, the actions we do take will earn enhanced legitimacy worldwide for their adherence to the rule of law. These are not new themes, but I raise them here because of they resonate squarely with the strategy we have been pursuing in cyberspace over the past few years. Of course, the United States has impressive cyber-capabilities; it should be clear from the bulk of my discussion that adherence to established principles of law does not prevent us from using those capabilities to achieve important ends. But we also know that we will be safer, the more that we can rally other States to the view that these established principles do impose meaningful constraints, and that there is already an existing set of laws that protect our security in cyberspace. And the more widespread the understanding that cyberspace follows established rules – and that we live by them – the stronger we can be in pushing back against those who would seek to introduce brand new rules that may be contrary to our interests. That is why, in our diplomacy, we do not whisper about these issues. We talk openly and bilaterally with other countries about the application of established international law to cyberspace. We talk about these issues multilaterally, at the UN Group of Governmental Experts and at other fora, in promoting this vision of compliance with international law in cyberspace. We talk about them regionally, as when we recently co-sponsored an ASEAN Regional Forum event to focus the international community’s attention on the problem of proxy actors engaging in unlawful conduct in cyberspace. Preventing proxy attacks on us is an important interest, and as part of our discussions we have outlined the ways that existing international law addresses this problem. The diplomacy I have described is not limited to the legal issues this group of lawyers is used to facing in the operational context. These issues are interconnected with countless other cyber issues that we face daily in our foreign policy, such as cybersecurity, cyber-commerce, human rights in cyberspace, and public diplomacy through cybertools. In all of these areas, let me repeat again, compliance with international law in cyberspace is part and parcel of our broader smart power approach to international law as part of U.S. foreign policy. Compliance with international law – and thinking actively together about how best to promote that compliance – can only free us to do more, and to do more legitimately, in the emerging frontiers of cyberspace, in a way that more fully promotes our U.S. national interests. Thank you very much.

TITLE: The Organization of American States' Inter-American Committee Against Terrorism Inauguration of Cybersecurity Mobile Lab

TEXT: Good Morning. Mr. Assistant Secretary General Albert Ramdin, Distinguished Ambassadors, Inter-American Committee Against Terrorism (CICTE) Executive Secretary Neil Klopfenstein, and other honored guests, thank you for being here today. It’s a great pleasure to say a few words on behalf of the United States as we see some of the important work that CICTE is doing first hand in the realm of cybersecurity. President Obama has said that the “cyber threat is one of the most serious economic and national security challenges we face as a nation” and affirmed that “America’s economic prosperity in the 21st century will depend on cyber-security.” Cybersecurity is a key area of interest for the U.S. government. Attacks on information and communications infrastructure could potentially cause major damage to key sectors of the U.S. and global economy, such as energy, banking and finance, and public health and safety. Therefore, cybersecurity is not just an issue for certain countries in the region. Cybercrime is a transnational threat, along with terrorism and terrorists’ use of the Internet, and is an increasing concern in the Western Hemisphere, as the Hemisphere has one of the fastest growth rates of Internet usage in the world. Within the Western Hemisphere, CICTE has played and will continue to play a critical role in the coordination of cybersecurity initiatives, including capacity building, and in facilitating regional cooperation. The CICTE Cyber Security program has become a key forum in the Americas for debate and the exchange of ideas about current and future cybersecurity trends. The United States has supported and will continue to support this program. It has provided a solid foundation for collaboration among countries on these issues, creating a valuable way for Member States to interact on this subject. We are particularly pleased to have contributed towards this specific project: an innovative and specialized cyber mobile laboratory to be used for the implementation of a series of sub-regional cyber security “Crisis Management Exercises” across the Hemisphere. We hope this cyber mobile lab will provide the OAS with new flexibility in conducting consistent, cutting-edge training and exercises in countries across the Hemisphere, regardless of existing cyber capabilities. We believe that it can play an important role in improving the entire region's preparedness against cyber attacks. It is through ongoing regional programs such as these that we will continually strengthen our joint efforts in the realm of cybersecurity. We thank the OAS/CICTE Secretariat for their good will in this area. Again, thank you very much for coming today, and I hope this demonstration provides you a small window into the great work CICTE is doing in this critical and constantly-evolving area.

TITLE: Strengthening Cyber Security in the Americas

TEXT: I want to thank the Committee for the opportunity to speak today. I view this meeting and the draft declaration as an important milestone for hemispheric security, one that should be recognized clearly as striving to meet the cyber security challenge articulated nearly a decade ago right here at a time when CICTE was first defining its mission. In 2002, at a time when few nations recognized the implications of a networked world or imagined the profound impact that the Internet would have on our economies and our societies, we came together to discuss the concern that the benefits of information technology might not fully be realized if the security and reliability of these systems were threatened. We concluded that no matter what steps individual states might take to safeguard their own critical information infrastructures, none of us would be secure until all of us performed our national due diligence with regard to cyber security. We also understood that national efforts, while necessary, were themselves not sufficient, and that transnational cooperation was essential if we were to have any success. In fact, malicious actors were purposefully routing attacks across several national boundaries to decrease the probability of detection or prosecution. We understood that we faced a transnational threat and we needed to build our capacity to defend and to pool our expertise to prevent such activities. We understood that regardless of the motivations of those who might attack us or disrupt our networks, they all use the same sorts of tools, exploit the same vulnerabilities, and can potentially cause similar sorts of damage. The answer was clear: working together we would be stronger than working apart. In fact, the OAS member states were prescient, and unprecedented in their efforts to organize the hemisphere to cope with the challenge to cyber security. The OAS development and subsequent adoption of a Comprehensive Inter-American Strategy to Combat Threats to Cybersecurity was unique, and ahead of its time, in understanding that cyber security was a cross-cutting issue and required the participation of stakeholders across a variety of disciplines. We needed REMJA and its work on modernizing substantive and procedural cybercrime laws in the hemisphere to assure that we could investigate and prosecute transnationally. In many cases, we were finding that transnational criminal groups had levels of cyber skills and access to technology that exceeded the capabilities of law enforcement and security forces. By 2002, OAS had already recognized the imperative for modern legislative approaches to cybercrime as contained in a lengthy list of recommendations made by the Third REMJA, based on those of the 1999 Group of Governmental Experts on Cybercrime. In addition, it was recognized that special expertise was needed in law enforcement communities to adequately perform investigative tasks. It was also clear by 2002 that little of what needed to be done on cybersecurity could be accomplished without the support and participation of the private sector. Because most of the information infrastructures that we rely on both for government functions and our economic well-being are in the hands of the private sector, it was understood that security could not be a government-only responsibility. The private sector not only owns the systems, they own the important information about incidents. In order to make defenses work, information needed to be shared between government and the private sector in a meaningful way, but there were barriers to that cooperation. We needed CITEL to provide the bridge that would ensure the participation of the private sector operators of the information infrastructures that governments wanted to protect. But it was left to CICTE to do the heavy lifting. We wanted all states to take tangible steps to reduce risk to critical national and global information infrastructures. To do that required both prevention/protection efforts and incident mitigation - that is, managing consequences and getting networks back up and functioning if prevention fails. Risk reduction also requires warning or prediction of imminent threats - a goal in which international cooperation is essential. Taken together, these tasks required member states to identify or establish a national capability for 24/7 incident management, cyber threat assessment and mitigation. This was a tall order for a hemisphere that had only 5 significant Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTS) in 2002. Few member states had a national CSIRT then. Therefore, we view CICTE's efforts to foster CSIRT development in the hemisphere over the past decade as nothing less than phenomenal. The OAS/CICTE Cyber Security program has become the main forum in the Americas for debate and the exchange of ideas about current and future cyber security trends. This program has provided a unique degree of collaboration between countries on these issues, creating a valuable space for open interaction as equals among Member States. Among the many benefits that this program has to offer is that its participants have the opportunity to interact with and learn from counterparts in other Member States, and discuss similar responsibilities and challenges. These efforts have paid off. Since 2004 the number of national governmental CSIRTs has increased from 5 to 16, and CICTE anticipates that additional countries will establish a national CSIRT in the coming year. The OAS Network of CSIRTs and Cyber Security officials have allowed incident response officers to respond to cyber security incidents in an environment of security and trust. Additional interactions through training activities, workshops and meetings have fostered stronger lines of communication, and above all, TRUST. One important feature of the CICTE cyber-security program is the political consensus that member states have shared on its importance, urgency and direction. The CICTE Secretariat also has been promoting the development of National Cyber Security Strategies, which is also extremely important. In 2011, Colombia was the first country whose request for assistance from CICTE resulted in the adoption of a National Cyber Security and Cyber Defense Strategy and the establishment of a national CSIRT. CICTE is also working on the promotion and development of similar initiatives in other Latin American and Caribbean countries. I would also note that REMJA's Cybercrime Working Group actively assists member states to develop cybercrime laws and enhance capacity to investigate and prosecute crimes involving computers and the Internet. Three workshops are held yearly on various topics in the three regions of OAS -- South America, Central America, and the Caribbean. Most recently for 2010 and 2011, workshops were held in Mexico City, Mexico, Lima, Peru, and Antigua-Barbuda. In conjunction with CICTE, hemispheric workshops were also held in Miami and Bogota. This year, workshops are scheduled to be held in Guatemala, Jamaica, Uruguay, and Lima. In addition, four member states are contemplating accession to the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime, and many more have introduced bills to update their substantive and procedural laws based on the Convention. We calculate that the investigative and computer forensic capacity of at least 3 countries have been improved directly by this program. CITEL works with the private sector to coordinate regional positions on telecommunications standards, radiocommunication spectrum use, broadcasting, and telecommunication policy in the Americas. The Member States of the region depend heavily on CITEL to provide the mechanism for developing regional input (Inter-American Proposals) to the International Telecommunication Union where regional positions hold significant influence on global telecommunication decisions. In the recent past, regional positions have had tremendous impact on turning back proposals for unequal taxation on international telecommunications, and have provided the basis for spectrum allocation that is of benefit to the entire region. The accomplishments of the last decade have been significant and provide a model for other multilateral institutions. The declaration that you are considering at this twelfth regular meeting of CICTE reaffirms that agenda and recognizes the central role that information technology plays in all of our nations by committing to: increasing efforts to build CSIRTs and strengthen cooperation; by continuing to build the capacity within member states to establish and implement national cybersecurity strategies; and by underscoring the importance of promoting public-private sector cooperation in support of the security of critical information infrastructures. The United States supports these goals fully and looks forward to working with you to advance them. The environment that we now call "cyberspace" has changed our world over the last decade in ways that we predicted and in many ways we did not. The degree of the dependency of modern societies on information technology for all operations of daily life could not have been foreseen a decade ago. That dependency is only increasing, and with it, so is our stake in a stable cyberspace environment -- even as our vulnerabilities and those who would disrupt that environment become more motivated and more sophisticated. It is no longer enough for us to focus on the hemisphere; we are all being drawn into a larger debate about the future of cyberspace. If we want to create a stable international environment where we can reap the benefits that networked information technology has to offer - economic advantage and new markets, the intellectual synergies that come from a vast market place of ideas - then we need to envision how we can work to better shape the future in cyberspace. Ambassador Benjamin mentioned in his remarks last summer's release of a US International Strategy for Cyberspace. That strategy emphasizes, among other things, that we all need to build a consensus among like minded states in support of principled norms for state behavior in cyberspace. Implicit in that document is that the generation coming of age today will never know a world without personal digital devices. In raising our children, we use norms every day to guide their moral and ethical behavior. I view norms in cyberspace in much the same way – we should not seek laws by which governments should rule cyberspace but important values which guide our stewardship of this extraordinary technology that is transforming the world. We need to achieve a shared understanding of these values so that all peoples are able to reap the social, economic and other benefits information technology offers in a stable, reliable environment. This should not be difficult; this technology was born of a philosophy of freedom to connect and the open exchange of ideas. We must strive to preserve that progressive vision. Shared norms are needed to provide the architecture to guide how we relate to each other in this regard. Norms establish an environment of common expectations in which we can root our national policies and which will guide our international partnerships. We envision an Internet of the future accessible to all citizens; one that enables local business in every corner of the globe, just as it enables large corporations: where new ideas and innovations are spread, celebrated and incorporated to benefit mankind, and where people the world over connect with each other without barriers. This is our goal. I believe it is a global goal. To accomplish this vision, we all need to support the long-standing principles that brought us safely into the 21st century, and that continue to make this all possible. These principles are rooted in long-standing international precepts to which we all subscribe in other contexts and they apply here. We must: Uphold Fundamental Freedoms; Preserve Respect for Property; Value Privacy; Protect our citizens from crime; Retain our rights to self-defense; For cyberspace to flourish, we must also recognize the necessity for principles of behavior that facilitate its global penetration. These include: Global interoperability; Network Stability; Reliable Access; Multi-stakeholder Governance; National Cybersecurity Due Diligence; Sadly, this view is not, at this point, universally shared. There are those who believe that the Internet, in particular, threatens social and political stability and needs to be regulated domestically and defined by treaty internationally to justify the control of content; and that trade in technology needs to be restricted. There are others who abjure norms of behavior altogether because it would restrict behavior that, in every other context, would be considered criminal. In these visions, the Internet is Balkanized, stagnant because of government control, or beset with crime, with no trust or transparency among countries. This would undermine not only the social benefit of the Internet but its economic promise as well. I view this meeting as an important brick in the wall of a strategic consensus we must build-- a consensus that will lead us to become a coalition of like-minded states who, together, with the incentive of the benefit that information technology can bring to us all, will arrive at a common vision of the norms that will yield an environment of international cyber stability. When we unveiled the new U.S. International Strategy for Cyberspace in Washington last summer, Secretary of State Clinton said that this collection of cyber issues is a new foreign policy imperative for the United States. And we have made it so. In every bilateral, multilateral, and international venue that will hear us, we are raising the issue of norms and seeking an international dialogue with the goal of eventual consensus. We believe the vision – of an environment in which norms of responsible behavior guide states’ actions, sustain economic partnerships, and support the rule of law in cyberspace – is one shared by all. I believe we are making progress, and I ask you to join us in carrying the vision forward. In the coming year, we will seek to convene a Regional Cyber Dialogue in the hemisphere to begin a conversation on these principles. We want to hear regional views, needs and concerns, and how we can work together to enable all states to participate fully in achieving this vision regardless of their level of development. We would welcome the participation of any of you, your private sector and your civil society, that want to engage in this dialogue. As Secretary of State Clinton remarked when she released the International Strategy for Cyberspace last May, “So, we seek to maximize the Internet’s tremendous capacity to accelerate human progress, while sharpening our response and tools to deal with the threats, the problems and the disputes that are part of cyberspace.” I am confident that, working together, and working with all of you, we can do exactly that. I look forward to the next ten years of CICTE leadership.

TITLE: Leading With Diplomacy to Strengthen Stability in Space

TEXT: Thank you for your kind introduction. I am honored to have been invited back to the Symposium to give a keynote speech this year. When I spoke last year, the focus was on the President’s new National Space Policy, which has a greater emphasis than ever before on the role diplomacy can and should play in space, and on the need for U.S. leadership. Last month, Secretary Clinton gave a speech on American global leadership where she said, “In such a complex world, it is no longer enough to be strong. You also have to be smart and persuasive. The test of our leadership going forward will be our ability to mobilize disparate people and nations to work together to solve common problems, and advance shared values and aspirations.” While these remarks were on U.S. foreign policy in general, they apply remarkably well to U.S. space policy. The world is increasingly interconnected through, and increasingly dependent on, space systems. Our prosperity and security rely on communication, navigation, financial activities, and scores of other activities that depend on information derived from space systems. The space environment, with its challenges of natural and man-made threats, is as complex as the world Secretary Clinton described. This complexity means that all nations must work together to adopt approaches for responsible behavior in space, and the United States, with our history of leadership in space, must lead the pursuit of potential solutions to these shared challenges. Certainly no one in this audience needs to be reminded of the congested and contested nature of space, nor of the President’s goals for expanding international cooperation, strengthening stability in space, and increasing assurance and resilience of mission-essential functions. However, some of you may not be familiar with the active leadership role and responsibilities the State Department and diplomacy have in addressing the President’s goals. Orbital Debris Mitigation. One issue that underlines the need for international cooperation and diplomacy is the growing presence of debris in space. There are now approximately 21,000 pieces of trackable debris 10 centimeters or larger in various Earth orbits – about 6,000 metric tons of debris orbiting the Earth. While some pieces of debris are simply “dead” satellites or spent booster upper stages still orbiting, and others are the results of accidents or mishaps, such as the 2009 Cosmos-Iridium collision, some debris is the result of intentionally destructive events, such as China’s test in space of an anti-satellite weapon in 2007. Experts warn that the quantity and density of man-made debris significantly increase the odds of future damaging collisions. To address the growing problem of orbital debris, the United States, through the State Department, has expanded its engagement within the United Nations and with other governments and non-governmental organizations. We are continuing to lead the development and adoption of international standards to minimize debris, building upon the foundation of the U.N. Space Debris Mitigation Guidelines. We are also working to develop international and industry standards to slow down the accumulation of debris in space, and to develop and implement international “best practices” of responsible behavior in space that will put us all on a more sustainable path. Space Situational Awareness. International cooperation is also necessary to ensure that we have robust situational awareness of the space environment. No one knows better than U.S. Strategic Command that even with the best technology and expertise available, no one nation has the resources to precisely track every space object. The U.S. National Space Policy implicitly recognizes this fact and thus directs us to collaborate with foreign governments, the private sector, and other organizations to improve our space situational awareness. One example of our efforts to cooperate internationally in the area of space situational awareness is our collaboration with Europe as it develops its own space situational awareness, or SSA system. The Department of State, in close collaboration with the Department of Defense, is currently engaged in policy and technical exchanges with regional and international organizations such as the European Union and the European Space Agency, as well as the governments of individual European allies. These discussions are considering approaches to protect our shared security interests as well as measures to ensure interoperability between our current and planned SSA architectures. Looking ahead, we also see opportunities for cooperation on SSA with our allies and partners in the Asia-Pacific and other regions. Prevention of Satellite Collisions. International cooperation is also essential to prevent future collisions through the sharing of information with other space-faring nations and our industry partners. As a result, we are seeking to improve our ability to share information with other space-faring nations as well as with our industry partners. The National Space Policy calls for international collaboration on the dissemination of orbital tracking information, including predictions of potentially hazardous conjunctions between orbiting objects. Such collaboration has the benefit of not only preserving the sustainability of space through the prevention of collisions, but improving our own capabilities to conduct expanded space object detection, characterization, and tracking and maintaining the space object catalogue. In coordination with U.S. Strategic Command, the Department of State is working to facilitate the rapid notification of space hazards via Conjunction Summary Messages by reaching out to all space-faring nations to ensure that the Joint Space Operations Center has reliable contact information for transmitting timely notification messages to both government and private sector satellite operations centers. Critical Infrastructure Protection. The assurance and resilience of mission-essential functions also benefits from international collaboration. Led by the Department of State, Critical Infrastructure Protection workshops between the United States and the EU seek to identify trans-Atlantic interdependencies, vulnerabilities, and risk-mitigation strategies. The goal of these workshops is to increase the assurance and resilience of mission-essential functions that are enabled by commercial and civil spacecraft and supporting infrastructures against disruption, degradation, and destruction, whether from environmental, mechanical, electronic, or hostile causes. These workshops include the participation of U.S. Strategic Command, which is the lead within the Department of Defense for the protection of defense space critical infrastructures as well as the USG’s responses to purposeful interference against U.S. space interests. Bilateral and Multilateral TCBMs. The examples I just mentioned represent the new role the Department of State is taking in regards to national security space policy. However, we are also taking a more active leadership role within the functions traditionally within State’s purview. One of the ways the State Department is helping the United States move forward with ensuring safety, sustainability, stability, and security in space is through our pursuit of near-term, voluntary, and pragmatic transparency and confidence-building measures (TCBMs). TCBMs are means by which countries can address challenges and share information with the aim of creating mutual understanding and reducing tensions between countries. Through TCBMs we can address important areas such as orbital debris, space situational awareness, and collision avoidance, as well as increase familiarity and trust and encourage openness among space actors. The United States conducts a variety of bilateral and multilateral TCBMs to encourage responsible actions in space. The State Department developed and regularly conducts space security dialogues and discussions with traditional allies and partners such as Australia, France, Japan, Canada, and the United Kingdom. With the creation of the new National Space Policy, the State Department has also focused on reaching out to key emerging space-faring nations to begin similar dialogues. For example, following the February 2009 collision between a commercial Iridium spacecraft and an inactive Russian military satellite, the United States and Russia were in direct communication to discuss the incident. This experience has contributed to an on-going bilateral dialogue with Russia on developing additional concrete and pragmatic bilateral TCBMs that will enhance spaceflight safety. Our recognition of the importance in working with our Russian counterparts to strengthen stability in space has led us to hold three space security dialogues in the past 16 months. The global reliance on space systems means that the challenges of operating in space cannot be addressed by a few parties, but must be recognized and tackled by many. To that end, the State Department engages on space in a variety of multinational fora, from the U.N. General Assembly to the Conference on Disarmament. We believe that efforts to adopt space TCBMs should be built upon “bottom up” initiatives developed by government and private sector satellite operators as well as from “top down” government-to-government negotiations. Therefore, the State Department is taking a leadership role in the working group of the UN Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS) on long-term sustainability. The long-term sustainability working group on space activities will be a key forum for the international development of “best practices guidelines” for space activities, including orbital debris mitigation, collision warning and avoidance, and space situational awareness. All of these activities can enhance spaceflight safety for space operators and are foundational to pursuing TCBMs that enhance stability and security. The State Department is also anticipating next year’s Group of Government Experts (or GGE) on Outer Space TCBMs established by UN General Assembly Resolution 65/68. We support the full consideration of all helpful proposals for bilateral and multilateral TCBMs. Such proposals could include measures aimed at enhancing the transparency of national security space policies, strategies, activities and experiments or notifications regarding environmental or unintentional hazards to spaceflight safety. International consultations to prevent incidents in outer space and to prevent or minimize the risks of potentially harmful interference could also be a helpful TCBM to consider. We look forward to working with our international colleagues to engage in a GGE that serves as a constructive mechanism to examine voluntary and pragmatic TCBMs that enhance stability and security, and promote responsible operations in space. The space environment is at serious risk from a number of sources, including space debris and a lack of transparency in the conduct of space activities. It is our belief that one of the most beneficial multilateral TCBMs for strengthening stability in space could be the adoption of “best practice” guidelines or an international “code of conduct.” A code of conduct could help establish guidelines for safe and responsible use of space, avoid collisions, reduce radiofrequency interference, and call out irresponsible behavior. Unless the international community adopts positive measures to address irresponsible behavior in space, the environment around our planet will become increasingly hazardous to both human and robotic spaceflight. To that end, the United States is actively considering the European Union’s proposal for a non-legally binding, international “Code of Conduct for Outer Space Activities.” We have consulted with the EU over the past four years and see the EU’s initiative as a promising basis for an international Code of Conduct. Such a “Code,” if accepted by established and emerging space powers, could help promote best practices and ensure the long-term safety, sustainability, security, and stability of the space environment. Conclusion. Efforts to strengthen stability and security in space must be complemented by continued U.S. leadership in the area of international cooperation to ensure the safety and long-term sustainability of space activities in a congested, contested, and complex space environment. Consequently, the State Department is committed to taking a more active leadership role in international space cooperation and diplomacy. As Secretary Clinton has said, “in the 21st century, the most important players in international affairs will be the ones who make things happen, who get results, not those who block progress. And the United States will stand with the problem-solvers because that’s who we are.” Thank you very much.

TITLE: Background Briefing: Secretary Clinton's Participation in the London Conference on Cyberspace

TEXT: MS. FULTON: All right. Thank you. And thanks everybody for joining us today. We are very happy to have with us, [Senior State Department Official] who will from this point forward be known as Senior State Department Official, who is going to discuss Secretary Clinton’s participation in the London Conference on Cyberspace coming up this week. So I’d like to go ahead and turn it over to our Senior State Department Official, and following his remarks, we’ll go ahead and open it up for questions. So without further ado, we’ll turn it over. SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL: Thanks, Heide. Well, first, I wanted to set the stage. This is part of a larger effort, international cyber diplomacy effort, that the State Department is undertaking that’s weaving all of these different aspects of cyberspace together, and that includes everything from areas where the Secretary has been a strong leader for years, like internet freedom, to economic issues and governance issues on the internet, to cyber security issues, to cyber crime issues, to even kind of political-military issues, that full sweep of issues that is also captured in a very integrated way in the international strategy for cyberspace that was released by President Obama and which the Secretary helped launch back in May. And I think it’s significant of two things that she said in that launch. One is that this basket of issues, given where we are in the development of this technology, and really we’re in a crossroads I think right now in terms of the decisions being made today and how that’s going to affect the future, that these – this basket of issues is now a foreign policy imperative or a foreign policy priority. And that’s important because I think for too long people have looked at all these different issues either as niche issues or issues that are technical issues and not really larger foreign policy issues. And as we become so dependent on these technologies, as it really is so pervasive into almost everything we do and the way we think about both growing our economy and our societies, that it’s really important to elevate these, not just in the U.S., which has been done, A, through this international strategy, but also by the efforts of the Secretary, and frankly in the creation of my office, we were the first – she created my office back in February and – to coordinate all these different issues, and that was the first time in a foreign ministry that that kind of post was created. Other countries are following suit to really make this more of a foreign policy issue, but also to get other countries to focus on this. That is one of the goals of the Hague conference, Foreign Minister Hague conference in London, to bring a lot of senior folks together from around the world, from, I think, over 60 countries, to really – in part, to raise the awareness but also to move forward on a whole range of different issues there. The other thing she said at that launch, which I think is very important, is that this is something that’s going to require patient, persistent, and creative diplomacy, that this is not necessarily a thing where we’re going to change or make all the decisions overnight, but it’s something that we have to, over a number of years, build a consensus in the international community around certain norms of behavior and certain ways of thinking about cyberspace that will preserve its openness, preserve security, and preserve prosperity as we go forward, all things I think we’ve been very blessed to have in terms of how the technology has grown up so far. So as – I think her – I think one of the things that I believe she’ll do when she speaks is build on her prior discussions in this area, which have been internet freedom, and then in January she talked about both internet freedom and some of the challenges and tensions. In the launch of the international strategy, she talked about some of the issues I just mentioned, the importance of getting countries to think about these norms. And then I think she’ll dig down into some of the issues we face. So for instance, there are different visions of the future of the internet, where some governments would like to see it being very state-centrically driven, driven by a particular treaty instrument. And that really flies in the face of the way the internet’s grown up, which has been a multi-stakeholder system, which has had industry and civil society and governments all working together and all having a role. And that’s one of those challenges we face going into the future. She’s going to, I think, talk about the challenges of cyber crime and some of the things that we’re doing about that. She’s going to talk about, I believe, even some of the challenges around cyber conflict and how we can actually reduce the chance of cyber conflict by building more transparency, by building confidence-building measures between countries. And she’ll also certainly talk about the very – the big promise of the internet, what it’s been able to deliver to us, and particularly, I think with respect to both internet freedom and our economic growth and innovation, why it’s so important to maintain the system, to make sure the system thrives in the future and that we want to make sure that the decisions that are being made on these technologies and all these different international fora don’t interfere with that. So I think that’s the general sweep of the issues that are going to be talked about. And – hold on a second – and (inaudible) just came in, sorry – and that – and also that as we think about these norms for cyberspace we have existing norms. We don’t need to create a whole new set of rules of cyberspace; we can rely on the rules that exist but apply them to this digital world. And I think this is also going to be an invitation to countries around the world, both regionally and bilaterally, to work with us to realize that future. There’s been a lot of good activity. The OECD recently had these internet policy making principles that came out; the G-8 featured the internet in its leader’s declaration this year. There’s been work in lots of different regional fora, and that’s been, I think, something that’s been really important, but this is really work that’s vital as we go forward in all of our different diplomatic channels.

TITLE: Cybersecurity Update

TEXT: MR. PAINTER: Thanks, and thanks for coming here today. I wanted to do two things. The main focus I wanted to have today is on something that we’re doing in the U.S. but also something we’re working with countries around the world to either emulate or to try to make sure we’re coordinated, and that is something we call – and this is October – National Cyber Security Awareness Month. So it’s all month. It’s the month of October, and it is a particular time for us where we try to engage the government, the private sector, and the everyday user, I mean, people around the country, and really focusing more on this issue of cyber security and what they can do about it. The particular theme for the last several years – and this is the ninth year we’ve had National Cyber Security Awareness Month – is that this is a shared responsibility. It’s not just a government responsibility, it’s not just a private sector responsibility, it’s not just an individual responsibility, but it’s a shared responsibility because all of us have a role to play in this. And our Department of Homeland Security has done quite a lot of work in this area and is doing events all month long to really resound this theme. Other countries as well at different times during the year have been doing this. Canada, I believe, is doing it this month as well. Other countries are looking at the same sort of focus and messaging. In part, I think that reflects a growing understanding of our reliance in the world on cyber technologies and for really everything we do in life, for everything from financial transactions to working and to talking to each other and social interactions, and I think also a growing awareness of the possible vulnerabilities out there, the criminal and other actors who could be attacking those systems, and the real challenges that they pose. Back in the U.S. a couple of years ago now, back in May of 2009, President Obama gave a speech calling the cyber security issue one of the greatest economic and national security threats that we face as a nation. Similarly, many other countries around the world have – now have cyber security strategies, including the UK and Germany and many, many others, the Netherlands and many others. And I think many others are looking at how they’re going to organize this issue, recognizing it’s not just a kind of technical issue but much more of an important policy issue. That was also highlighted – and I think the last time I came and talked to folks here was when we released our international strategy for cyber space. And this was, for the first time, trying to tie all the different issues in cyber space together, not just cyber security or cyber crime, but also internet freedom, internet governance issues, economic issues, all under one framework that we’re trying to achieve an open, interoperable, secure, and reliable information and communications infrastructure, not just here in the United States but around the world. And when Secretary Clinton launched that strategy, she said in her speech two things that I think are very important to resonate here or to repeat here: one, that this basket of issues – cyber security, cyber crime, internet freedom, governance, all those issues together – are a new foreign policy priority for us and a new foreign policy imperative; and two, that this will require patient, persistent, and creative diplomacy to try to build a consensus of countries around this issue. So the two things I really want to talk about is, first, what we’re doing here in this National Cyber Security Awareness Month and working with countries – the EU and other countries around the world – to have that similar level of awareness. And I think that’s critically important. And I think that reflects one of the core values that’s in our international strategy and in our discussions with other country partners, too, which is the multi-stakeholder nature of the internet, that it’s not just a government issue, it’s not just run by governments, but the private sector and the civil society have to be involved. And that multi-stakeholder model is what allowed the internet to succeed and to thrive for both economic reasons and for social reasons. And if you think about all these different issues – the economic innovation and the economic growth and the social innovation and the free flow of information at the top of a pyramid, and security and protection from crime and protection of privacy are all on the base of the pyramid, they are all of the foundational things that allow that to happen. So as we are now in October, it’s important to focus on how we can engage all those different stakeholders both here in this country, but I think it’s imperative for every country around the world to think of how to engage those stakeholders to think about this issue and to protect their networks and to make sure that this incredibly transformative technology continues into the future. Now, the other thing I wanted to mention briefly is that when I last talked to, as I said, the international strategy had come out. We – Secretary Clinton created my office, the Office of the Coordinator for Cyber Issues, that just began work in the end of February. I think we had handed out a fact sheet about that to you today. The point of that office is to coordinate throughout our Department of State all the different strands of internet policy, whether it be the economic issues and the governance issues or the cyber security and other issues, and put them together and to really lead our global diplomatic engagement to make sure that we are taking forward the important work of working with other countries to make sure that this vision of cyberspace is open, interoperable, secure, and reliable cyber space is the one that prevails, and that we have the kind of growth that we’ve seen before. One of the key parts of that is to take forward work in the development of norms, to make sure that – and the discussion of norms in cyberspace. And so we laid some of those out in our international strategy, and they include ones that are unique to cyberspace and ones that are not. So the ones that are not are things like upholding fundamental freedoms, respect for property, valuing privacy, protection from crime, the right to self-defense. All of those would apply equally in the physical world to how they would apply in the cyber world. And then there are ones that are more unique to this environment, like global interoperability or network stability or reliable access or this multi-stakeholder governance model that I discussed or states taking actions to increase their cyber security. So all of those different issues – some of the issues, I think there are some pretty developed ways of thinking about, like cyber crime. There is something called the Budapest Convention, which many countries have signed or are emulating its provisions, to try to get laws around the world to be more compatible, make sure you have a floor of laws and an ability to communicate and to cooperate among countries. But others of these areas that are not very developed, the discussion is not very developed. So it’s critically important that we have this discussion of norms in the international community, that we use this patient, persistent, and creative diplomacy to engage with other countries around the world to make sure that we are advancing this vision. On that score, I’d just note a couple of things that have happened since that has come out. One is the G-8 Leaders Declaration that happened after the Deauville Summit, and that featured the internet very prominently as part of the declaration and really had all of those components in it. It talked about free flow of information and social aspects. It talked about governance. It talked about security. And I think that was a very important document. Another is the OECD issued a communiqué with internet policy-making principles. So it’s centered on this idea of the multi-stakeholder governance system. And we’ve also been working in other forums around the world. And as I think many of you know, Foreign Minister Hague is holding a conference in London soon to talk about all of these cyber norms and how we can really begin a discussion and build consensus around this area as we go forward. I think this is something we’ll be discussing for several years. I think this is an important topic that’s become ever more important both in our government and other governments. And so I think there’s a lot of work to do, but I see substantial progress already being made. So with that, I’d like to open it up to questions, talk about some of these specific issues.

TITLE: Release of the Obama Administration's International Strategy for Cyberspace

TEXT: MODERATOR: Thank you, everyone, for coming to the Foreign Press Center so early in the morning. We have with us today Mr. Christopher Painter, the State Department’s Coordinator for Cyber Issues. He’s with us today to discuss the Administration’s International Strategy for Cyber Issues. Before we begin, just one quick reminder, please turn off all cell phones or anything else that will make a noise during the discussion. We also have participation via phone, so during the question-and-answer session we’ll move from participants in the room and participants on the telephone. MR. PAINTER: Great. Well, thank you all for being here today. I very much appreciate it and I’m very excited to be here to talk about the President’s International Strategy for Cyberspace and also the State Department’s role in that document and going forward, pivoting off that document, what we’re going to be doing in the future. This strategy is really important if you look at what it is. It tries for the first time, and it does for the first time, pull together all the different strands of our policies in cyberspace from internet freedom issues to internet governance issues, to security issues, to military issues, to cyber crime issues, to economic issues, and puts them really all in one framework for the first time. Now, why is that important? It’s important because in the past, both we and, frankly, I think, other nations too have looked at this issues in silos. And we’ve done a lot of great work, and there’s been a lot of benefit that the internet has given us over the last 20 years as we’ve developed this new technology and cyberspace more generally. But all of these issues are interrelated and all of those policies are interrelated, and I don't think you can really understand how important or what the future of this technology will be without looking at all of these different policies together. So what this document does, and one of the very significant things it does, is it pulls these all together in one coherent fashion that really lays out, I think, for the first time what our goals are in cyberspace, what the future we’d like to see achieved in cyberspace. And I should note this is not – although this is a strategy that’s issued by our President, is it not a uniquely American vision. It is a vision that should be, and is, a world vision. And one of the key things behind this strategy is to find partners and to build a consensus around it. The goal that we lay out is a future for cyberspace that is open, interoperable, secure, and reliable, that is something that can undergird and promote economic growth and innovation, free expression, the free flow of information. And to achieve that goal and to build that future, that we want to sustain an environment where norms of responsible behavior guide states’ actions, sustain partnerships, and support the rule of law in cyberspace. So that’s the goal. And you can’t get anywhere if you don’t have a goal. If you don’t know where your destination is, you can’t get there. And I think it’s important to have that as our goal, not just for us but for all of our partners working together. And this strategy really is a signpost. It is sort of the GPS to find where that goal is, to find that destination that we want to for this really powerful and transformative technology. The other thing the strategy does is it focuses on a couple of different areas. It lays out a number of policy priorities, and those include and those are: the economy – promoting international standards for open and innovative markets, that includes sustaining free trade, protecting intellectual property, for instance; protecting our networks by enhancing security, reliability, and resiliency, that all nations need to protect their networks and work together to do that; and that includes promoting cooperation in cyberspace, promoting the rule of law in cyberspace, promoting norms in cyberspace; law enforcement collaboration, and again, the rule of law in that area; military – making sure that we are protecting our own systems and prepared to act in this area; internet governance, that we have a multi-stakeholder approach to internet governance that keeps the internet open and interoperable; international development – building capacity in this area. I think one of the really important things for us going forward is, as I said, this is not a uniquely American vision. It means partnering with the rest of the world, including the developing world, and making sure that we and other nations are helping to build that capacity, whether it’s legal capacity or technical capacity in other countries. And finally, but not last, internet freedom – the free flow of information, the right of expression online, one of the things that the Secretary has been very vocal about in the past. Now, how do we get to this goal? We get to this goal by having some core principles, which are set up in this document, and then trying to define norms of behavior around those principles by finding allies and building a consensus around this vision in the international community. And there’s lot of opportunities to do this. Virtually every international organization around the world is looking at some aspect of the cyberspace suite of issues. And therefore, there’s many opportunities to build consensuses in those multilateral organizations, but also bilaterally with all of the partners we have all over the world, and have a constructive dialogue around this. There are many things coming up. There’s the OECD – there’s an OECD meeting on high-level principles with respect to the internet, policy making principles. That’s in June. There’s the G-8 that’s coming up in – very soon, next week, where President Sarkozy has made the internet one of the core aspects of that meeting. There is the conference that Foreign Minister Hague of the UK has called for at the end of the year to discuss some of these norms of behavior. But there’s multiple different forums where we can carry this forward. And I think there are two other aspects of this. We’ve often looked at this issue in the past as being a technical issue or a security issue or a speech issue. And looking at it holistically, looking at all these things together, does what the Secretary said when she spoke on this on Monday; it really creates a new foreign policy imperative. This is really a new foreign policy area and a priority, not just for the United States but around the world. In part, the creation of the office that I have by the Secretary just two months ago, the coordinator for cyber issues, was meant to do exactly what this strategy talks about: to bring together all these different areas in the State Department and engage globally with our partners in trying to realize this vision. So that’s one important thing we’ve already started to do. What the Secretary said in her speech was that this is – one of the core ways we achieve this vision is through diplomacy, through patient, persistent, and creative diplomacy. And that’s exactly what we need to do. Again, as she said, this is not a series of prescriptions, and that would be inappropriate. It’s not a series of prescriptions for the rest of the world. This is a series of priorities that we have of our vision, but a vision that we want to be a shared vision. And it is a – and we should not, and we are not, telling the rest of the world what to do. What we’re trying to do is get the rest of the world to join us in partnership around this document. So with that – and I think you’ve all either seen or can see the document – it’s been posted now – I will open it up to questions, because I think that might be more interactive.

TITLE: Remarks on the Release of President Obama Administration's International Strategy for Cyberspace

TEXT: Well, thank you very much. As you can guess from John’s introductory remarks, we are very pleased this day has come. We are delighted at the extraordinary work that has been done across our government with the unveiling of this International Strategy for Cyberspace, and we look forward to partnering with our private sector, with other nations, and with others who share the goal that is set forth in this new document that really tries to achieve the goal that is set forth in the very beginning, and that is, the United States will work internationally to promote an open, interoperable, secure, and reliable information and communications infrastructure that supports international trade and commerce, strengthens international security, and fosters free expression and innovation. To achieve that goal, we will build and sustain an environment in which norms of responsible behavior guides states actions, sustains partnerships, and support the rule of law in cyberspace. This is a policy that very much sums up what the United States seeks. Many of you representing the governments of other countries, as well as the private sector or foundations or civil society groups, share our commitment to ensuring that the internet remains open, secure, and free, not only for the 2 billion people who are now online, but for the billions more who will be online in the years ahead. What they are able to do in cyberspace, whether they can exchange ideas and opinions openly, freely explore the subjects of their choosing, stay safe from cyber criminals, and engage in professional and personal activities online, confident that doing so will remain private and secure, depends a great deal on the policies that we will adopt together. Now, many of you know that the State Department has staked out a position as a leader on internet freedom, and I see Alec Ross, who has headed our efforts on that. This is one critical aspect of cyber policy. But we know very well that the numbers of issues seem to be infinitely expanding, and we need to develop, deploy, and coordinate policies that address the full array of cyber issues. That is what the U.S. International Strategy for Cyberspace is intended to help us do. Because it does, as John said, bring together, for the first time under one framework, all the different policies that the United States is pursuing into an integrated whole-of-government approach. It also articulates, for the first time, all of the principles that guide our work – those that infuse our foreign policy, such as upholding the fundamental freedoms that we consider internet freedom to be part of, and all the other aspects of this policy that will be addressed by my colleagues. We try to really tackle all of the difficult issues and challenges that cyberspace presents. And we know very well that everything we’ve written today we will have to keep updating as new challenges and opportunities arise. Because while the internet offers new ways for people to exercise their political rights, it also, as we have seen very clearly in the last months, gives governments new tools for clamping down on dissent. And while the internet creates new economic opportunities for people at every point on the development spectrum, it also gives criminals new openings to steal personal data and intellectual property. And while the internet makes it possible for governments and people to collaborate more closely across borders, it presents new terrain for conflict, when states or other actors deliberately disrupt networks or when terrorists use the internet to organize attacks. So, we seek to maximize the internet’s tremendous capacity to accelerate human progress, while sharpening our response and our tools to deal with the threats and the problems and the disputes that are part of cyberspace. Now, as we look at this strategy, I want to be clear about what it is not. It is not a series of prescriptions, and that’s an important distinction. Because as we work to achieve a cyberspace that is open, interoperable, secure, and reliable, there is no one-size-fits-all, straightforward route to that goal. We have to build a global consensus around a shared vision for the future of cyberspace to make sure it serves, rather than impedes, the social, economic, and political aspirations of people worldwide. And that can only happen through patient, persistent, and creative diplomacy. So the strategy identifies seven key policy priorities that will be the focus of our diplomatic outreach going forward. They are: first, economic engagement to encourage innovation and trade while safeguarding intellectual property; second, cyber security to protect our networks and strengthen international security; third, law enforcement to improve our ability to respond to cyber-crime, including by strengthening international laws and regulations where appropriate; next, military cooperation to help our alliances do more together to confront cyber threats while ensuring that our military’s networks remain protected; next, multi-stakeholder internet governance so that networks work the way they should; and then, development to support the rise of new partners by helping countries develop their digital infrastructure and build their capacity to withstand cyber threats; and finally, but for us very importantly, internet freedom. We want to do more together to protect privacy and secure fundamental freedoms of expression, assembly, and association, online as we do offline. Together, these seven priorities comprise a new foreign policy imperative for which the State Department has been exercising and will continue to have a leading role. Now, what we are trying to do in furtherance of those imperatives is to integrate cyber issues into our programs across the board, from our cooperation with other nations to stop criminal cartels, to our economic diplomacy, to our support for girls and women worldwide. We’ve created our 21st century statecraft agenda to harness new technologies to achieve our diplomatic and development goals, and we want to continue to press forward on this with the partners that we see here before us. We are sponsoring capacity-building efforts around the world to help more countries play a bigger role in the internet. And as our focus on internet freedom clearly describes, we are supporting the efforts of human rights and democracy activists to ensure that they have access to an open internet. We are funding cutting-edge programs to give them the tools and the know-how to communicate effectively and safely to get their message out, even as governments try to silence them or cut them off from the internet. To coordinate these and other efforts, we’ve created the new Office of the Coordinator for Cyber Issues. Chris Painter, a longtime expert in the field, is now on the job at the State Department, having joined us from the White House and the NSC, where he helped lead the development of the strategy we’re releasing today. Chris’s office is taking the lead at the State Department as we work with other nations and partners to promote these broad goals. Now, we’re entering a next phase in our engagement with cyberspace based on this strategy, and we’re seeing how countries are adjusting their own policies and approaches. And we’re understanding that we can’t have disparate, stoved-piped discussions, because as many countries have begun to focus more on internet policies and as more citizens have gone online, too often the international discussions we have about cyber issues deals with each of these challenges separately. Our diplomats meet with their counterparts on cyber crime, and then on another occasion on internet freedom, and then finally, on a third, on network security. We are not dealing with these issues internationally in a coordinated, integrated fashion, and so now we will based on our strategy. And our hope is that you will actually read this strategy, that you will engage with us on it, that you will look at, understand our principles and our approach, and then join us in helping to put them into practice. We are seeing cyberspace transform before our very eyes. Now we have to shape that transformation, and we are excited that this strategy is going to give us the roadmap that we will follow going forward. And I look forward to working with you in the months ahead to translate this strategy into action. And it’s now my pleasure to introduce my colleague, Attorney General Eric Holder.

TITLE: Cyberspace - Taming the Wild West

TEXT: Nina Fedoroff [Science and Technology Adviser to the Secretary]: Welcome to the -- wow -- to the distinguished Jefferson Lecture Series. Our speaker today is Dr. John Savage and he has much to say so my introduction is very short. He received his undergraduate and graduate degrees from MIT. He’s a professor in the Department of Computer Science at Brown University where he served as Chairman from 1985 to 1991. He’s published three books and stacks of papers. He’s a Fellow of the IEEE, the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers, as well as the AAAS [American Association for the Advancement of Science] and everybody knows what that stands for. And he’s going to tell us about how to tame cyberspace. John Savage: So before I begin I would like to make it clear that I am speaking as an individual. I’m here as a Jefferson Science Fellow, I’m not speaking for my office and I say that because my office happens to be the Cyber Affairs Office in the Bureau of Intelligence and Research. So this is a personal talk today. I’m going to give you an introduction to the Internet, explain some of the basic ideas, we’ll talk about threats, approaches we can take to these, and we’ll look ahead. I don’t think I need to introduce you to the Internet, we know that it is used in many places to facilitate free speech, but not everywhere apparently. But it also creates opportunities for innovation, and we’re seeing many new threats. Crime is on the rise; it’s a very serious problem; the threat of terrorism is out there; and we do have threats to our critical infrastructure, which I will outline later. And we have even the possibility of cyber conflict. It is changing; the Internet is changing our culture. But as my title suggests, it is in many ways the Wild West. We -- I liken the hackers to the gunslingers and the town to the millions of unprotected computers, and so I ask where is the sheriff? We do need a sheriff. In the old days we would slap a badge on a hacker whom we thought we could turn, and that person we brought inside, and then we would expect to be protected. We need a new approach to that now. So one of the questions we’re going to address today is how do we protect ourselves and our assets. Now we’ll start with a little introduction to the Internet. As this graph suggests, we have here a collection of networks. We’ve got on this side, a yellow network, a red network, and a green network. We have three routers and a name server. And the Internet is characterized by the fact that we transmit packets through the Internet. This is a system that supports packet switching. We use the IP Protocol, which I’ll explain in a moment. The important part about a packet switching network is that the packets have source and destination addresses. They leave one site, they move to another site. At that site a decision is made as to which next site will be followed. In other words you don’t create an end to end path and have all the packets follow that path. This IP Protocol packages these packets into a header and a payload. The header has a little information, it has the source address, it has the destination address. It tells you how long the packet -- the payload is, how long this packet has to live. And if the packet arrives at a node, and it’s exceeded its time to live it’s destroyed. And this basic Internet protocol only makes the best effort to transmit data. The Transmission Control Protocol was introduced in 1974 by Cerf and Kahn, and that’s -- we call it TCP/IP. It was designed to provide reliable end to end communications, and again as I said, you take a large data stream and you packetize it, the packets are sent and they follow paths that may be very different. But the key feature here is that a packet that is sent and not acknowledged at the source gets resent, so you might have multiple copies of a packet floating through the network. It also means that these packets have to be reassembled at the destination. And it’s a building block for lots of other protocols; this transmission protocol is so important that we now will -- we often refer to Cerf and Kahn as the fathers of the Internet. So it’s time we spent a moment or two on domain name servers. These are sites which takes the names that we like to use, such as www.example.com, and translate them into numerical addresses. These numerical addresses are used to transmit packets to the network. This is important, as you’ll see in a short while. When -- before the domain name system was introduced Bob Kahn used to keep these mappings between usernames and numbers on a 3 x 5 card in his pocket, and after a while it became -- he had too many cards and he turned it over to someone else, and that person then maintained it using traditional tools, [inaudible] and so forth, but eventually, the whole system had to be automated. And now we have domain name servers that are scattered all over the world. The Internet began with experiments with networks in the ’60s and ’70s in universities typically. And in the ’70s Bob Kahn supervised the introduction of the ARPANET. If you’re not familiar with APA it’s an acronym meaning Advanced Projects Agency; it’s a branch of the Department of Defense, and they since the ’70s have been funding a great deal of -- since the ’60s, actually -- been funding a lot of research in networks and other areas of computer science. There were a number of commercial networks were introduced in the ’70s and ’80s, there was NSFNET. But an important event occurred in ’82 when the military decided they were going to use TCP/IP for their communications. And then you had, as you know, in the ’90s the introduction of the browser, the World Wide Web was introduced, and then the rest is history. Explosive growth. There are a whole bunch of applications today for the Internet, you’re familiar with them al so I’m not going to run through them. There has been renewed attention given to the Internet recently, the President of the United States made this statement, he said “... our interconnected world presents us, at once, with great promise but also great peril.” You have the current Director of National Intelligence Dennis Blair saying that “Malicious cyber activities are occurring at an unprecedented scale with extraordinary sophistication.” and that “We cannot be certain that our cyber space will be available and reliable during a time of crisis.” His predecessor Mike McConnell in the Washington Post says, “As the most wired nation on earth we offer the targets of most significance yet our cyber defenses are woefully lacking. The problem is that we lack a cohesive strategy to meet this challenge.” So, how about some examples of the severity of the problem? It is said that U.S, citizens lost almost a half a billion in 2009. I’m told that there are more than 600 million attacks per day against Department of Defense Computers. And this one, this event, attracted my attention because I have not heard many stories about computers actually being damaged. In Norfolk, Virginia, early in February, one day in February as folks were logging out, they found that their computer were taking a long time to log out. And when the staff investigated they found that a program was running and what this program did is it erased about two-thirds of the operating system. They call that a time bomb. Now, what’s also alarming is this town Norfolk happens to be home to the world’s largest Naval Base. I saw that I said, “Whoops, this can happen in Norfolk, it can happen anywhere.” It was this attack that Google announced in early January, they announced that about 30 companies were attacked at the same they were and others have estimated that it was more than that number. Some of these companies called on McAfee to help them out, and to diagnose the problems. And what McAfee has reported publicly is that corporate repositories were attacked. They were penetrated. There is a common source code management system called Per Force, it’s an American company based in Los Angeles, I believe, whose software was used to manage these repositories at many of the companies that McAfee was familiar with. Google has said that they lost intellectual property; others are speculating that these intruders actually modified some of the programs and maybe some of the documents, non programming documents for other computers. And this worries me because our economy is based on intellectual property. We depend on that. We’re not a large manufacturing company anymore, we generate ideas, and they get reflected in intellectual property. So if we lose that intellectual property, or if others tamper with it, degrade it in some way, I think that represents a very serious development. So I’m going to give you a little exposure to a little introduction to the critical infrastructure that’s available online and can be attacked. The power grid is, of course, maybe the preeminent of these. There are experts, they know where the power grid is, the goal here is to put new electrical meters in your home, that are computer based, they’re computer powered, on the Internet. So that utilities can collect information about your power usage. They’re also going to invest in integrating the many hundreds of individual power generating companies across the country. But there is speculation that hackers can get inside these meters on your home, and they have many robots that they can use to do attacks on the Internet. And last Sunday there was an article that appeared in The New York Times co-authored by John Markoff, citing the fact that a Chinese student and his professor wrote a paper for an [inaudible] publication, in which they have given a scenario, described a scenario in which a portion of the U.S. power grid can be brought down, and when you bring it down it causes the rest of the grid to collapse. That’s…quite concerning. How about the financial and banking system? I’m going to give you some facts here that are shocking. We have two principle clearance firms, clearance systems, in the United States for bank transactions. One of these is the Fedwire, the other is CHIPS, and one report that I saw said that CHIPS carries about 96 percent of the clearance traffic with U.S. banks. And I know that back in 2008, $2 trillion were cleared per day. Now let’s put that into perspective. The U.S. GDP is $14.2 trillions per year. So if this clearance system were disrupted, someone came in and brought a time bomb in and erased the memory or something of that sort, the havoc that could result would be tremendous. And as I’m sure you know, most of the communication networks in the world are privately held, at least in the United States are privately held and outside they’re held by governments, many of them. We use those; all of the nations use those strategic communications. So I’m going to spend a few minutes here talking about the kinds of attacks one could make. These are traditional classifications here: Insider attacks, close-in attacks, and remote attacks. You as an individual can sit at your laptop, at your desk-side computer, and you can run a little program, and it will sniff the traffic that passes on the local network between your computer and that of the others in the local network. And today that traffic is unprotected. A close-in attacker can communicate through a wireless link. You know many of us will not encrypt our wireless links, or if we do we’ll use a password. The most common password in use for logins today is 123456, something like that. So, you know, breaking the security of these things is not necessarily as hard as one would think. Once you’ve violated that security, then you impersonate a user on the network, and you can steal that user’s traffic. Remote attackers, Kevin Mitnick used to break into telephone company computers by impersonating an employee of the telephone company. Called up, say, plead, he’d say he forgot his password or whatever it took to get in and people would readily hand over the information he needed. But today you can probe a computer remotely over the Internet. You know all about -- I’m sure you all know about social engineering. We receive e-mails with links in them, fishing expeditions they’re called; spear fishing; sometimes they’re called whale fishing when it’s an individual who is very important. And you’re tempted to click on a link and you click on a link, and, bingo, your computer is now under the control of somebody else. But that’s also done with instant messaging, it’s done with Twitter, it’s done on Facebook. You know, it’s amazing what people are doing today. And there’s another kind of attack we don’t talk about very much; that’s manipulating the domain name system. Here’s an outline of a type of attack that might be done remotely. The steps that are taken are the following: The target is enticed by a trusted source to click on a link, the effect is that the browser will then pursue, will follow that link to a remote site. At that remote site you download a program. That program now is designed to exploit a hole in the application you’re running. For example if you’re using Windows browser i.e., six or seven, you download this payload and it’s designed to find, to do perhaps a buffer for overflow attack; it’s some kind of attack that in effect takes over the computer. That little program that’s downloaded now opens up a back door, meaning it gives access to a hacker -- attacker -- to come in from the outside, and it connects to a command and control service that goes to another machine. At that machine it downloads a larger program, and now it’s ready to roll. The attacker can then move around, try to move around within the local area network, can decide what information to extract if that’s the goal, et cetera. So the major types of attack, the ones that consist of seize and control of a computer, as I just mentioned. The second is a distributed denial of service attack where an attacker, a malicious person has controlled a large number of computers, and this individual then sends requests to one computer, so that it overwhelms the computer. This is the kind of attack that was used in Estonia in 2007. They were able to rescue themselves by moving a lot of their accounts off to I think Google servers or Akemi Servers, where they had much higher bandwidth, and it wasn’t possible to overwhelm those other sites. You can also do a redirection attack, and you can do this down at the level of the domain name server, where you -- and I don’t want to go into details, because they’re pretty detailed attacks, but you can redirect people who are seeking to move to one website to move to another. So you might redirect people going to Bank of America site to your personal financial transactions and have them move to another site with a Web page that looks just like the Bank of America site, and they use that to capture all your information. We’re given traditional advice on how to avoid infection; and you should follow that. I’m going to give you a few minutes on botnets because I think they’re very interesting. A bot is an infected computer, and the folks who collect these things and run them are called bot herders. Here’s a fascinating tidbit; you can buy a PC based botnet at four cents per PC. But as we all know, Mac, Apple can charge higher prices for their products. Turns out that if you want a Mac botnet it’s going to cost you 43 cents per machine. A botnet, when they were first introduced, I’m told, they were used for targeted activities, for example, it might be used to ex-filtrate financial data or they might alert unsuspecting users, or ex-filtrate intellectual properties from technology companies what have you. And then as they age, let us say, as they become better known, they will revert -- use them for spamming. They might use them eventually for denial service attacks. This is a whole lifetime; they evolve over time. The botnets have to be run with a command and control. You have to have control. There has to be some site that is in control of these botnets, at least periodically; give them instructions, tell them when to do things, at what time to do things. And these command and control sites move around. These bot herders are very clever; so as a consequence, suppression is actually quite difficult. There is a botnet called Mariposa that was created by Spanish amateurs; these are not computer scientists, these are just basically criminals. Went out on the net and they found -- they bought the technology they needed and they managed, however, to infect machines in over 190 countries. They infected half of the Fortune 1000 companies; stole financial data from 13 million computers, and they were arrested. And they thought the botnet was shut down forever, right? But in fact the virus or whatever is still on the loose, and it’s now jumped to cell phones. This chart you can’t see, I’m sure, so I’m going to ask you – this is a list of botnets by country, provided by Team Cormarie, which is a digital forensics company in Wales. And at the top is “Other” followed by Greece. And then the United Arab Emirates; they don’t have many botnets. The second from the bottom is Germany, and which nation do you think is on the bottom and has most of the botnets? The U.S. of A, right. Okay, now, that doesn’t mean that we -- that they’re Americans who are running these botnets. For all we know, these could be Russian hackers, or Ukrainians, or Chinese. We don’t know who owns those botnets, but it’s due to the fact that we have a lot of computers that are not protected. I’m going to give you an example of another botnet, the Zeus botnet. It started spreading I think in 2008, and by 2009 it was very evident all over the place and they compromised by June 74,000 accounts; is said to have at least 4 million bots, and you can buy, or acquire, do-it-yourself kits to create your own Zeus botnet. In the last December, it was discovered that their command and control for this botnet were found at the Amazon Cloud. Now do you know what the Amazon Cloud is? Amazon and a number of other companies offer cloud computing. These are large collections of PCs that are in racks, and with a cloud, what you do is you buy time and you buy storage capacity. In fact my son has a company that does exactly this. And these clouds have advantages, they use less energy, and are less expensive than owning your own computer, but they were found on the Amazon Cloud. If you wanted to stop the Zeus botnet, or a botnet like that, and you say command and control is on the Amazon Cloud, what would you have to do? If we came to a national emergency, what would you have to do? You would have to turn off the Amazon Cloud. That would have a huge impact on the economy. In fact what happened, something like this happened in Kazakhstan and a service provider out there failed, or was taken offline somehow. I don’t think it’s known how it happened but 25 percent of the Zeus botnet was cut off as a consequence. Now here’s another interesting development. In February this year a new botnet organization appears called SpyEye, it’s thought to be Russian, and it has a Zeus killer feature. That is to say, it will steal botnets from Zeus. So the bot wars have begun [laughs]. It’s a whole culture here that’s developing. I also want to point out as I’ve suggested before that our networks really are vulnerable. You know in this country we really have a backbone that runs across country by large companies that have high capacity communication domestic channels. You’re all aware I’m sure that we have cables down to the seas, to Europe, to Asia, et cetera. They carry a lot of traffic; if those cables were taken out, that would severely disrupt the Internet. As I mentioned the routers and the DNS service can also be targeted; you know, by stealing data. The good news is that the DNS servers are being secured as we speak. I think .gov is now fully secure, they’re working on .com, and it should be, I’m told, within about two years, half of all of the different route zones associated with the last three letters in an IP address will be protected, so there is progress on that front. As I said local networks can be easily spoofed. So let’s talk about handling attacks. Clearly nations need to improve their defenses. The bad news here, I came to the State Department, I started -- took an interest in this topic of security last year when I knew I was going to be serving as a Jefferson Science Fellow, and I thought initially that there would be a magic bullet that one could find and that you could make computers completely secure. I’m now persuaded that that’s not the case, that there’s always going to be a cat-and-mouse game. You’re going to have folks trying to fill the holes, attempting to find new defenses and the hackers are always going to be out there competing with you. But what can be done is our systems can be -- in the short term -- is our systems can be more resilient. Back at my department at Brown we have a server that handles the mail. We also have a slave on that server, so when that server fails, the slave, that’s completely up-to-date, knows that the master has failed, and it will take over the mail service. Things of that sort are needed, you know? Increasing the bandwidth of our cables at critical locations on the Internet is also another way to deal with denial service attacks. But if that isn’t sufficient, we might just ask ourselves as a nation: What do we do next? Are we going to get aggressive? And then the question you should ask is: Does that put us at risk? Now, before we talk about this risky aspect of things, I think it’s good to pause and ask, well: How serious could a cyber attack be? So I’m asking these as a question to you for -- these are rhetorical questions. Temporarily disabling the computers at Norfolk is not such a big deal, you know, in a couple of weeks or so they can be restored. But if you were to take out the computer systems in Washington D.C., how would you feel about that? Losing a million credit cards…that might be important to us. How many of you have lost a credit card? Had it stolen from you? Okay, me too, all right. So, you know that, we can live with that. Here in this room, another Jefferson Science Fellow, Paul Kinter, last fall gave us a talk on space weather, and he talked about the GPS system. And pointed out that in the U.S. electrical grid, the GPS is being used to synchronize the local power suppliers. They used to use atomic clocks but they were too expensive, so they found they could do the same thing with GPS, so fine, they’re using GPS. He pointed out that if there were a major solar flare, lasting, I don’t know how long, I don’t remember how long it was, but, you know, a short while, that could disrupt these GPS receivers, and the effect could be to cause havoc with our electrical grid. If the military Internet were to be disabled, how would you feel about that? How would you think that would be an act of war, or…this is an interesting question. How about disrupting that bank clearance system? And you say okay, we’re going to freeze something like $2 or $3 trillion in transactions? That would be alarming I think, and certainly if you destroy the electrical power grid, I think that could get us quite exercised. The U.S. response to all these challenges has been to create the Comprehensive National Cyber Security Initiative, and it has these three main goals. First is to defend against immediate threats and that’s why communicating information between states and the federal government -- within the federal government and with states, private companies, to try to defend and protect against immediate threats. But looking out a little further their goal is to enhance our counterintelligence, and to deal with supply chain issues. Now this is a new issue in this talk; supply chain. What is the supply chain? Well, the computer I have here has software on it, hardware that almost certainly is not produced in the United States. We don’t know, with many of our computers, what is in them. It’s entirely possible that there could be chips sold to the U.S. government that have a kill switch in them, which means you can cause a machine to turn off. Now, if you did that with a fighter aircraft, I think that would be very alarming. You could do the same thing with the software. So that’s a very important issue, and we certainly need to take it seriously. The third goal of the CNCI is to deal with the future by expanding some effort on cyber education, by redirecting our research priorities, and finding strategies to deter the criminal and hostile elements we have out there. I’m going to talk about cyber deterrents for a minute. I want to ask: Under what conditions should a government consider retaliation? But before you do that, there are several issues you need to address. First is who did it? You really need to know for sure the source of an attack before you retaliate. You should also know what collateral damage will occur, and you should understand the domestic repercussions. It’s very interesting then to know that the National Academy of Sciences is starting a new study on cyber deterrents, and you are all invited to submit proposals. They would like to have their proposals by April 1 but that is not a hard deadline so if you went out exercised and want to contribute something, you go to the National Academy’s website and you’ll see an invitation. You’ve seen this one before: “On the Internet, nobody knows you’re a dog.” So attribution is really hard on the Internet. It is possible to direct attribution just after an attack has occurred, I say is possible, it is not always possible but it may be possible, but later it’s going to be difficult. And the reason it is that you can trace a packet backwards through the Internet. And the way that that’s done is the various nodes on the Internet had kept a log of the data that moves through that site; so you can follow that data, use those logs to find your way back through the Internet. But the data is ephemeral. They need the storage, they don’t have enough storage, so they cannot keep the information for an extended period of time; they have to discard it. So that means if you’re pursuing a crime then you have to be quick about it. And especially if that criminal element you’re dealing with is not domestically based. If that criminal element is located in Europe some place, you want to be on the phone with your counterpart in Europe to try to get them to order an issue to collect that data. But hiding packet sources has been easy, it’s very easy when you send a packet, as the sender, you can supply any source address. You should supply as your address the name of your site, but you don’t need to do that. But I’m told that spoofing is not often done these days, at least you know botnets they don’t bother hiding where they’re coming from. There is a technique called Fastblocks that can be used, but they generally don’t try to spoof their addresses it takes too much time and they’re in the interest of sending as much spam out there or doing whatever they do. But there are also anonymizers, this is a network of computers, the purpose of which is to hide the packets so that you can’t find where they come from. And there will be a number of nodes that will participate in this; they will encrypt the information so that it gets encrypted multiple times as it passes through the network, and then it gets decrypted, that’s an onion. And these are apparently very effective in hiding sources from destinations. With traffic analysis, if you know, if you can watch all the traffic going into the onion router, such are the set of networks, the set of machines that fall under this onion router, and you watch the traffic coming out, then you may be able to determine who sent a particular message. But what we do need to do is develop smarter routers and better traffic analysis. Let’s talk about collateral damage and repercussions. Many of the Internet attacks are really difficult to control because they’re based on viruses and worms, and when you launch a worm, you don’t know where it’s going to go. It’s given instructions to try and move to another machine, and so they’re progress is not predictable. You can damage yourself as well as your friends, so if we are going to employ cyber tech, it’s pretty clear that we need to have good deterrence capability. We may suffer more than others as a consequence; deterrence is not likely to be credible if the retaliation is not sure. So I want to bring your attention now to a couple of issues that I think are really at the root of many of these problems. Microsoft has been very successful as a company, hasn’t it? And as a consequence we have in essence a kind of monoculture; you have one type of operating system on most of the platforms around the world. People say that you don’t have to have antivirus software on your Mac because the hackers are not interested in Macs. That’s because there are too few Macs out there in the world; it’s not because the Mac cannot be penetrated. Any computer can be penetrated. But if the point here is if you have a monoculture, you have one type of software, one operating system, one type of application such as Adobe -- the application Adobe Reader now has more penetrations, it’s said, than Microsoft Word. The reason for this -- so if you learn how to attack one of these applications, one of these operating systems, then you can attack them all. And that’s the reason why we often say that the network is as weak as its weakest link. We also concentrate resources for efficiency. The Internet has -- suppose we took down, someone took down Google. A lot of us would be unhappy for quite a while. We’d have to use somebody else’s search engines, we might move to Bing for example, which is said to be equally as good. But there are a lot of choke points in the Internet, and disabling those could create problems. And as I mentioned before, cloud computing has become very popular. I could explain this to you but I don’t want to spend the time right now. Clouds do save energy, and they do reduce the cost of maintaining computer systems. But they also do concentrate resources in one place, and to me that’s very dangerous. And I mentioned the high bandwidth cables carry a lot of traffic. Also the Internet is a new medium, and as a new medium it requires, I think, some deep thought. How many of you remember Marshall McLuhan? The medium is the message? It’s not the younger generation but he was studying television when he made a big deal of studying it as a subject. As I mentioned, National Academy of Sciences has a cyber deterrent study underway, last year they finished a cyber attack study. They didn’t consult any classified information; they produced a book that is available. So, you know, we’re in an interesting position here. You can ask: What do we do next? Well, I think the cyber space issue is sufficiently important in challenging that the U.S. Government itself to a serious study of the subject. We have a Cyber Security Coordinator in the White House; unfortunately I don’t think that person has a very large staff. You know the Office of Science and Technology Policy; again, I don’t think there’s a large staff there either. I think it would be desirable to study this issue in the large and the broad context, and bring all of the players to the table; I’m not talking just about computer scientists, but policy makers, economists, people from business, industry, the banking community. Certainly we should encourage [unintelligible] to continue to improve security. I think we also are going to need some legislation. Because, you know, there was this CNN broadcast, this program about three or four weeks ago in which they had a team simulate a nation under cyber attack. It was a very interesting broadcast. They concluded that the federal government didn’t have enough legislation to really deal with the problem. There is legislation passing through Congress at the moment, and we’ll see what that produces. We also have to increase our engagement with international partners, and the reason for that is the Internet is global as we know; the crime on the Internet is global. We do need to establish norms of conduct for cyberspace, and we have to encourage our partners, our international partners, to try to seek adoption of these norms or maybe even enforcement. Dare I say that? And we should be, frankly, discussing the limits on aggressive use of cyber technology; I think the National Academy of Science is going to help in that regard, but I think more of us should be engaged. And we do need to educate the public. Right now the spear fishing attacks are -- we have no defense against them. I think one defense could be that we purchase a reputational service from a company that does track the spam out there, and if our reputational services don’t follow that link then we shouldn’t do that. We do have something akin to this now; your browser. If you use the Internet browser, you know that if you try to move to a site that does not have a certificate that’s been granted by one of the certificate authorities, the address bar turns bright red. And I’ve -- that’s happened to me recently. Firefox yesterday put up a nice dialogue box saying, this is an untrusted site, do you really want to go there? It’s that kind of service that will help all of us I think from creating a problem for ourselves by clicking the wrong links. And then we also need as a nation to invest in innovative R&D. I’m actually sitting on a couple of committees that are doing just that, as well as policy development. You know it’s not all gloom and doom, there are some leap-ahead technologies, these Comprehensive National Cyber Security Initiatives, CNCSI said we should look for leap-ahead technologies, and the Office of Science and Technology Policy last year conducted a study, they brought in academics, industrial people, and asked them to propose new technologies, and they did that; and amongst those that they proposed are ways to take the common software we use, and to produce variants of those. They perform the same function, but from the point of view of an attacker look different. So if an attacker has spent some time doing reconnaissance in your machine, and finds that it has certain vulnerabilities, the new variant of this machine will have different vulnerabilities; and so the reconnaissance will not be useful. If you change the operating system periodically, if every night you went to bed, your computer replaced the operating system, then if that operating system had been affected during the day that infection would be eliminated. That botnet, if you’re part of a botnet, you would drop out of the botnet. Another leap-ahead technology that’s being discussed is cyber economics, finding ways to use economics incentives to businesses to clean up their computers. So here’s an example: You go to an insurance company and say, we’d like you to introduce a cyber fraud insurance policy. If the company would then offer that policy to insurance company, or offer it to a company saying, “Listen, if you give us the incident data that you have received, the attacks that you have received, we will give you a lower rate.” Then those insurance companies can collect that data, pool it, in fact, amongst all the insurance companies, create actuarial tables, and based on that they can then reprice the insurance. And in addition, they could do what’s been done in a lot of businesses. If you sell insurance against injury to workers, those companies selling that kind of insurance will go into the workplace, and try to improve the workplace to reduce the number of accidents that occur. Well, insurance companies should do the same thing. So we could create an incentive system that would be designed to improve security. There’s another effort underway in the government, the Cyber Security Coordinator has created this committee and sub-committee structure, one of which is dealing with identity management, I happen to sit on that as well. And there are proposals to integrate secure identity management into our computer systems, into our applications. And identity management means that everyone has digital identities, you might have multiple, not just one, and they may be say a trusted third party that issues you those credentials, you use those to travel on the Internet, make purchases, things of that sort. If that can be integrated into operating systems, into applications, which is not done today, that may lead to more secure systems. I’ve mentioned supply chain; we really may have to do a lot more work on this, there is work being done in the advanced research projects agency to do analysis of CHIPS to see if they are doing what they’re supposed to be doing. There’s one development that occurred last year, this is crypto computing. The crypto computing problem was actually defined about 30 years ago by Ron Rivest and a few other people. And what they proposed is they asked the following question: They said is it possible to encrypt the data on which we compute, so that as we compute, we never have to decrypt it, and the results we get are still correct. That problem had no solution until May of last year when Craig Gentry, who just got his Ph.D. at Stanford University, presented a paper at a computer science theory conference. There is now a way to do this. You can not only encrypt the data, but you can also encrypt the programs, so that a person watching -- if your computer might have been compromised to the point where all the data is visible to an attacker, all of it, an attacker looking at this would not be able to determine what data you’re working with or what programs you’re running. Now, that’s the good news. The bad news is, right now, his techniques are very, very inefficient; very inefficient. But the good news is now he’s given inspiration to a lot of bright young minds who will, I hope, pursue this problem, and find either better complete solutions or partial solutions. So that’s very encouraging. So I only have a last word on security before closing here. Security is very difficult to establish. I’ve found -- I’ve read a paper in which the authors show that if you change one bit in memory, a standard program that’s in use today will malfunction when you should not have access granted to you. It illustrates how sensitive security really is. And then proving that a method that someone introduces to securitize the computation is secure, that in itself is challenging. When this Craig Gentry solved the crypto computing problem he had to rely on the security of another method of encryption called lattice encryption, lattice-based encryption. And that took a lot of work to prove. And this kind of thing requires mathematical thinking; it’s done by theoretical computer scientists and mathematicians. And my last point here is that it’s probably not prudent to assume that the world as it’s -- cyber space as we know it today is going to be the cyber space that we’ll live with in the future. And I make that point not just to give me a role to play because I am a theoretical computer scientists, but also because I think it is -- we should be thoughtful about the kinds of policy formulations we make because we don’t -- we want to know if policy as we formulate it is going to restrict us in the future, maybe prevent us from having secure solutions that we need, or not. But in any case, I think good policy formulation is probably it does require both good technologists and policy makers at the table. I thought I’d lighten things up with this one here: “Phil thought of the middle name, QX12PGY100, so he would always have a secure password that he could remember.” Okay, in the near term things are improving. Vendors do have robust securitization efforts. My son and my son-in-law are both at Microsoft. And my son is a developer and he has explained to me the techniques they use; they put a lot of money and effort into doing this since about 2001 or 2, and the number of bugs that have been reported is not going up; it seems to be going down. As I said earlier the DNS service which are a crucial part of the Internet are being hardened. And I think the prospects for improvement are good. I think academics -- I know academics are engaged in security research. I think they need more motivation. I think they need to hear from those of us who worry about this a lot; the U.S. Government is going to launch this leap-ahead research initiative in 2012. That holds a lot of promise. There are actually efforts under way now that look very promising. And certainly advanced discussions are under way as you may know, Michele Markoff and David Edelman of the Cyber Affairs Office have successfully launched a -- had a resolution passed on developing a global culture of cyber security. So in conclusion cyber space is really a new, a complex new medium; I think we’re coming to grips with it but it still presents lots of challenges. I think we’re going to be at it for decades, but the bottom line for me is that while it won’t be easy I think it’s going to be fun. Thank you very much.

TITLE: Future of the Cyber-Network

TEXT: Andrew Reynolds: So, good morning ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the first lecture of the Jefferson Science Fellows Distinguished Lecture Series for this academic year. Thank you for coming. We had initiated this lecture series last fall and we rely upon our Jefferson Science Fellows for substantive content of the lectures and we hope they continue to be of interest to you, our staff members and colleagues inside the State Department, as well as our wider community of scientists and engineers with which we associate ourselves.
My name is Andrew Reynolds. I am the deputy to our Science and Technology Advisor, Nina Fedoroff, who is traveling. She just departed yesterday for a long trip to the Middle East and Asia and she sends you her greetings. Nina is a Ph.D. scientist herself and, of course, has been the mentor for our Jefferson Fellows, both here and serving now as alumni. This morning we are talking about the cyber network and I'm sure you all appreciate how central that is to our world today, to the way we conduct business, to the way we conduct military affairs, to the way we communicate as citizens and this buzz about Internet is really at a peak right now because the question of Internet governance has so dominated our policy responsibilities: accessibility, and this in both the domestic setting and internationally and international organizations are hard at work considering this whole question of governance and physical infrastructure, including cyber security. If you are familiar with the ICANN, the International Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, that happens to be a central locus of the debate as well: who controls the Internet names and subject matter: the assignment. This administration, the Obama Administration, has put the Internet and cyber security at the center of its priority list of topics. They have a Special Assistant for Science Technology and Innovation in the White House by the name of Susan Crawford who was a former ICAS member, a board member, and has been a strong advocate in her career for net neutrality. Melissa Hathaway, the Cyber Security Chief at the National Security Council, also instrumentally involved: the budget, the supplemental and the long-term budget of this administration focusing on greater broadband access for our citizens, our businesses and our communities at large. And recently the cyberspace policy review was completed by the White House. So, I would commend you to have a look at that; it is the roadmap, if you will. And, of course, the DOD has established an undersecretary for cyber security, not insignificant any number of these issues and the timing; I can't say we were planning this. Michael is here today but yesterday Federal Communications Commission Chairman Genachowski announced proposed new rules for Internet service providers and that basically could treat all Internet traffic equally and to allow Internet access and through the networks with any nature of device. The industry will say there are constraints because of broadband limitations but net neutrality is guiding this principle, this set of proposals, and it will be treated on a case-by-case basis. So, it's a propitious time to hear from one of our experts and Professor Michael El-Batanouny has been assigned in the academic year 2009-2010 to our Office of International Communication and Information Policy in the State Department Bureau of Economic, Energy and Business Affairs. And we're very happy to have this morning Ambassador Philip Verveer with us, who heads this office. Welcome Ambassador. I'm glad you could take the time to hear one of our distinguished alumni speak today and I hope that Michael's insights are also useful to you. Michael is a professor of physics. He has been nearly 30 years at Boston University, is a well published, well documented researcher in his field and I think brings a unique perspective this morning on the future of the cyber network. I would like to invite Michael up to speak for maybe 25 minutes, as much time as you feel is necessary, but allow some time for questions and answers because that is part of the Distinguished Lecture Series idea to have some interaction. So, ladies and gentlemen, again, welcome. Please keep an eye out. We hold these lectures every month. The next one will be in late October and we will be notifying you through the normal channels about the topic. We're not quite sure which one we're going to choose for that particular lecture but, without further ado, Michael, please come up and give us your insights. Thank you very much and we will look for to some questions and answers. Michael El-Batanouny: Well, I'll be talking about the future of the cyber network and this work has come out of my work at the Office of International Communications and Information Policy in 2008-2009 and these were the people I collaborated with. The outline of my talk will be “Architecture and Operation of Current Network:” How the network works now and then I will introduce some emerging infrastructure services and applications and how the current operation of Internet [low audio] these new emerging technologies. And I will finally end up with putting a list of what we call the mega-projects around the world that are researching these topics and how will it happen in the future? Do we have to have evolved slowly or do we have to have a revolution and a clean slate; just remove everything and start from scratch? Okay, just to remind you of the jargon that's used, we call software applications things like word processing, photo manipulation; that's an application. And we can divide them into two categories: e-mail, Internet browsing, file transfer; these are all done over the Internet and, therefore, they are network applications and then these are productivity applications. Okay, if we are on the Internet how do we communicate? How do we send a message? We can send -- we can ask for a Web page or we can send an e-mail but everything is done in what we call a packet. So, if we have a message, that message, if it's an e-mail message, it's divided in two packets. Then each packet is put inside an envelope, and we call that the payload, and outside the envelope we have a header and the header, among the main things, has where it's going, the destination address, and where it's coming from, the source address. Among the other things that the header has is what's the number of the package? Is it number one, two, three, four? So, it gives that and then there is a protocol which I'll talk about in a second and a protocol basically specifies: is it a video? Is it an audio? Is it a file, because it can be treated differently and so on and of course the destination and originating address. A protocol is just a set of rules that govern communications. A protocol is just, to computers, is computers just like language to humans. So, for example, for two devices on the network to successfully communicate, they should understand the same set of protocols. Now the two main protocols that we use on the Internet now are what's called the transmission control protocol, TCP, and it's called connection oriented because it does reliable delivery of the packets in the sense that it sends out to the receiving end a message saying, "Are you ready?" The acknowledgment comes back and then the packet starts to go. Now if the packet does not receive the acknowledgment, it's not received, it will send it again and it will slow down, assuming that there is congestion and there's a lot of problem because of that sometimes. Some applications or some things don't need that and, therefore, they are encumbered. The second one is what's called user datagram protocol and that is a protocol -- it's called a connection list because it doesn't establish a connection and it's unreliable but it's fast. It just sends. It sends the messages. Of course, that works very well for streaming video and audio because you don't want to miss the sequence, okay, so you have to keep the sequence of the sound or the video because if a packet is not received and then it's resent it will arrive at a later time; so it will confuse the flow of conversation or the video. So, if you drop some, it's a millisecond or a couple of milliseconds. You will not notice something was dropped, okay? That's the main idea. So, each packet now is sent to its destination via an available route. The route might be taken by preceding packets but not necessarily. And at the receiving end the packets are collected in sequence, stripped as if you are taking something out of an envelope and put together again. Now how do we do that? Well, what happens is that you on the left basically are sending a packet or e-mail, one packet of an e-mail, and it's now routed through the Internet to the other end which happens to be, let's say, a Web server. So, all the communications, all the knowledge of the communications is between you and the end device, which is a server here so you specify what it's going to be like and the other end specifies how it's going to receive it and it's called an end-to-end communication. And all the things that you see in the middle -- it's taking a route and, therefore, we call them routers and each router's function is just to check the congestion in the neighboring routers and make sure to send it through the least congested router, okay? At the same time it will also take the shortest path to go. So, that's the function of the routers. The routers are just computers but they are designed and so on to do these functions. They could be if it's a huge traffic, it could be a supercomputer, or it could be just a small computer, a server. One of the routers you can have if you have something like a wireless router at home; that's a router. That's the simplest kind of router, okay? The ones at the edge of the -- this will be the Internet so there's an edge one. We call it an edge router or a border router; and the ones in the center are called core routers and they have different functions. Now I will take this and I will break it down to smaller parts. So I will check where you are first and if I look at that this is the smallest possible, except for your home computer, this is the smallest possible network. It's called a local – a LAN -- a local area network and it can be a couple of you and your boss, and maybe an assistant, and then is the server that has the e-mail and printers. If you sent an e-mail or something to be printed, you send it to there and it sends it to the printer. E-mail: it would send it out through the router to the Internet. Now, we get bigger. Then we have your home and you connect through a cable modem or DSL. And there is a business and they all connect to the -- ISP is the Internet Service Provider and when it goes to your local place, it sent to a regional place and so on. It goes on the Internet. Another view of the same thing, except we call your local as a point of presence, and then there is NAP which is the network access point. Suppose you have Comcast and somebody else you are sending to has Verizon. Then you have the -- Comcast and Verizon have to communicate and they communicate through what's called a network access point. This is another view and you are here. You're sending, let's say again, an e-mail, or a packet. It goes to an edge router and then it goes through many routers inside this cloud and it reaches the edge of this. This could be an ISP and the ISP router at the edge communicates with the other router at the edge through what's called a border gateway protocol so they have their own spoken language. This is a bigger one and now we have -- we call this an autonomous system and it's an ISP and there's another autonomous system, another ISP, and they communicate via the network access point. I should have drawn --this last one -- the autonomous system: that could be the State Department autonomous system and it should have – instead of – it can't go directly to the NAP. It should go to a point of presence for an ISP. So this drawing was not exactly correct. We also see a mail server and I'll talk about servers shortly and then we have the domain name server which will come up in my discussion. So servers are just computers and they are computers that are dedicated to do one or two or three services. That's a server. So a server can be an e-mail server or a web browser or for the printer or the domain name address; I will discuss that in a second and we have a proxy cache, a proxy or cache server and that serves a very interesting role. It's between you and whatever -- let's say you want to go to Amazon and you want a Web page from Amazon. That would get it for you but it will keep a copy of it at the proxy, so that if you need next time to get that item or that webpage or, let's say the emblem for it, it will be already available and downloaded and it saves time instead of having the whole thing coming from Amazon. Then there is a content server and a company like AKAMAI. AKAMAI has something like six 60,000 servers distributed around the world and, again, if you want to go to Amazon for -- some book came that's very important and everybody's buying it and it will basically create a big backlog at Amazon and -- now we have to go through a whole Internet. Let's say Amazon is in California so it has to go through all these routers and it causes congestion so instead of doing that, you have all these servers around the world: 60,000, and companies like Amazon, or CNN, and so on will contract with AKAMAI to mirror their product on to these servers and, therefore, it will save a lot of congestion from the network. Then the last one is – that I will also get to: the DHCP which is dynamic cost configuration protocol. Now the first thing I would like to talk about quickly is the addressing. How do we address? When you are sending some e-mail to somebody, how does the address work? Well, there are two parts to the address. There's something called the media access control, or MAC address, and the Internet protocol address. The analogy is the following. The MAC is exactly like your vehicle identification number. It basically is done by the manufacturer on the network interface card and it goes with you everywhere. So that never changes as long as you have the same computer. But there is also the license plate which can change if you move from one state to another state, okay, so this is not permanent. So that's the IP. Now, another analogy is if you are sending a letter by the mail you have the person's name and his residence address. The residence address can change. His name doesn't change. Now we come to how these IP addresses are done. Right now we are still working in version four and as I will point out shortly, there is a problem with that but it's written in like four pieces separated by dots. Each one can go from 0 to 255 so if you multiply that, you'll get that the total unique values are about four billion, 4.3 billion. Now when this was done everybody thought how could you have more than that? It's more than enough but it turns out that we're running out of these guys in less than two years, okay, so there is a big problem to that and that's why IPv6 has been designed and ready to go since 1998. It hasn't been adopted yet. So, I will discuss the problems with it. We have a problem with this and we have a problem with this. I will start with the top one. How can you remember 216.27.61.137? It's impossible to remember; and, therefore, we had to resort to something that is more friendly and the more friendly is that lower line. So if you're at the State Department you have your name and then .state.gov and that now is called a domain name; and the domain name has levels. Of course, gov is at the top level domain, TLD, and it can be gov. It can be .com, .edu, .mil and so on. If you are a country, you've got .fr, France, .jp, Japan, .ca, Canada and so on. As Andy was saying, all these assignments are supervised by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, ICANN. There is another thing that you probably are familiar with is this line, http. HTTP is a protocol, okay? It's a protocol for browsing and web and that specifies what protocol is going to be dealing with the connection between you and the web that you're trying to reach. And this is called -- the whole thing is called the uniform resource locator, URL. Now to be able to translate from host.state, .gov and the number, we have dictionaries and the dictionaries -- you basically give it the host.state.gov and it will give you the equivalent number. These are called domain name system server and of course you can see that now -- the main, there are 13 main servers like that. They are called the root servers and they have all possible entries in that dictionary, but each ISP or State Department has a smaller version of that, a subset of that. So there are many, many, many DNS servers. Now, the IP address can be interpreted in the following way. The first part is called the prefix and that defines the domain or the domain and sub-domain and so on; not the host, okay? It can be, for example -- in B-U you can have physics@bu and so on; physics.bu.edu or something like that or dot something, okay? And sub sub-domain and so on, and that's why we can use all the way to here. Okay, and the rest is the host. Okay, now after many iterations because of this -- it's a very large number of users now; there were iterations about how to use this and they formed aggregates and the aggregates basically are exactly like a zip code. So if you are sending a mail to 9-x-x-x, nine means you are on the West Coast in the zip code and then so post office here doesn't have to look at anything else except the first digit and it sends it to the West Coast. And then when it reaches one of the big centers of the post office, they look at the second, which is eight, which would be Washington and so on and so forth. So, the structure now of the IP address is done the same way; aggregated. And the main authority in that is the Internet Assigned Number Authority and it issues blocks of addresses to, let's say, regional ones which are called RIR. RIR and the regional ones take the block, divide it into smaller parts and gives it, let's say, to one huge ISP and then the ISP will take it, divide it into parts and give it to companies and businesses and so on. The problem with all that, that's not enough because we don't have enough of it. So there was sort of an ingenuity to try to keep it going and that's going to the network address translation. That's equivalent to -- suppose you have an office and the office has 10 people and then there is a switchboard at the [unintelligible] so when somebody calls he goes through the switchboard. The switchboard -- he says I need such and such person to talk to. Then there's an internal phone number, right, extension, internal that's not on the list outside. The same thing happens here. There is a -- for example Boston University has something like 168 dot, dot, dot, and that block is inside. It's not a public block. It's used only inside; so inside you can have these addresses and yet, on the outside, when you want to send something it takes a different number, okay? And now you can use the same block for the State Department, for Boston University, for MIT, and replicate and that can save a lot of space. In spite of all that, we still have a big problem with that. It's going to run out in less than two years. The one that assigns these -- if you log in and you want to get on the Internet you get an IP address and that's done via a, let's say, from the ISP via a VHCP server, okay? So that's how it's done and you are assigned a number. If you log out and you turned off your computer, you turn it on again, it will get another number from your ISP and so on and so forth. Now we come to the IPv6. I'm not going to spend a lot of time on that but the IPv6 solved the problem by having a very large address. As a matter of fact, there are 39 digits in there; so if you take these 39 digits and 3.4 times -- and they have 38 digits, 38 zeros. Now if you take that number and divide it by everybody all the population of the earth, 6.6 billion, you'll find that you'll get for each person five and 28 zeros, okay? Fascinating but the reason is not that you're going to have all these users. You can now assign blocks for certain different things. So now you make life easy. For example, you as a host can have more than one address. You can have an address for this, an address for that. So, it's really an endless -- hopefully, it's an endless resource of numbers. Of course, there are more things to talk about like security and so on, which is much better handled in IPv6 than IPv4. I'm not discussing security at all today, okay? So, this says that it has 64 bits; it's not important. And now we come to the emerging technology, and I will start talking about one of those technologies which is sensor networks. Sensor networks are everywhere today and they are going to increase incredibly, like exponentially in the future. Power companies have sensor networks that monitor all the grids. They monitor the houses. They monitor the grids and you can name it. In the military; it has huge sensor networks and so on. Now these sensor -- there you go: all possible sensors that you can have, all right? Now if you take any of those sensors, and you have millions of them, that is incredible. And now all these will have demands and things on the Internet and that's one of the big problems we have. So, there is one, for example. There is a power grid and there is a substation and the substation basically feeds electricity to houses and now these are intelligent houses because they all have sensors to monitor all the power that's going to them. So if you're power goes out, they know immediately where it happened, okay; and these are intelligent sensors and they can go through the Internet to the headquarters and tell them, "Oh it happened at such and such address." You have to pick that address and so on and -- so this is just one possibility. Now, sorry. Now how do these things work? And that I will come to when I talk about PEER- to-PEER and so on. So, but keep in mind that this is an enormous, enormous load on the Internet. Now this is the most important and most agile part of the modern technology or the modern technology -- or the emerging technology. We call it virtualization. So it can be virtual machines. I will talk about that or virtual memory, or virtual links, or virtual networks. What it says is basically it will give you, for any user, it will give you the impression that you are working alone on a device while it's really shared by many other people. That was the first -- it goes back to the ’60s when we had mainframe computers. When you had the mainframe computer you basically had a dumb terminal and your office connected to the computer. Now if you connect to the computer, you're the only one. You don't know that there are other users on that and, therefore, this is -- you had a virtual computer, virtual machine. You had a machine on a mainframe. You don't know anybody else that is using it. You are isolated and this is your virtual machine. That's virtualization in the first place. That's the virtualization in the ’60s. Okay, so now we come to virtualization today. One of the possible things about virtualization is what is a virtual server virtualization? Servers are very -- the load on the servers maybe is about 25 percent of their capacity, okay? So they really have a lot of unused capacity and, therefore, you can use it more. Now, as I said, the number of servers is exponential. It's mushrooming all over the place. The amount of power consumption, the amount of people that have -- the IT people that have to supervise it and run it and so on is incredible; and, therefore, this comes as a salvation or saving us from that and that is you now have -- you take one server, there's the hardware and there is the operating system; it could be Windows, or Linux, or Mac, and then you put what's called a virtualization hypervisor and that basically interacts with the operating system and then it can create different compartments. It's exactly like when you were on the mainframe. So you can have one system, let's say, operating with Linux and it does, let's say, domain name server, and the second one runs with, let's say, Windows and has mail and so on, on the same machine; and that can be established on a very short timescale, okay? You can remove it or you can add another one. It's all done by software and, therefore, you can have all these machines, okay, these virtual machines existing on one. Or you can have a few of them, a cluster of these servers, run by some control and they can adapt: add virtual servers as they want, take away, move -- one of the servers is bad so you can move it to another machine. So it's a very agile system and that's the first part of my discussion of virtual. So we see virtual servers. Now, we can also do virtual routers. So, we can create routers on the same machine: one router for this, one router for that and so on; and therefore, you don't have to run IP. You can run, you can have your own set of protocols for some other -- as you will see, for some other application or some other service; and therefore, you can create it. You can move it: all virtual and that's the beauty of it. So, and then the third part of virtualization is basically what we call overlays. Overlays: You have the network and you have these routers and so on but you can go over the Internet and you can have your own servers and that's what AKAMAI does and others do. You have your own servers and now you can use your servers as -- so even though you are going through as IP over the regular routers, you can use your servers to basically have a better metric which is what are the conditions for sending things? Should I send it this way or should I send it this way or should I send it this way? They would have a much better metric which is oriented for a specific service, okay? And then you can basically send it and that's done over the Internet. So how it's done; inside the packet there is a tag and when that tag arrives at the particular server, let's say it belongs to AKAMAI, then it is sent to another server with a new metric as if that server now is also acting as a router. Okay, but it's a problem. It's [unintelligible] It's a handicap. Why do you have to do that? Why can't you use your own protocols to be able to go very efficiently through all of the networks that you are interested in? We come to PEER-to-PEER. Remember, PEER-to-PEER came from -- remember Napster? What Napster's problem -- it was great; it was a genius idea. They said, "Okay, you can have on your computer: you can store a hundreds songs, and then 100 songs and so on," except Napster kept the list of all the songs and that was illegal and that's why they were shut down; but if you don't do that it's legal. The point is you can store probably a billion songs, distribute it among all the members of the group. You have a group, a group of peers. You can have all those; and therefore, you don't have to have a huge storage demand. You distribute it among the group, okay, and now the group will communicate with each other through a tag. So they have a tag and it can go from one member of the group, the Nq. I'm sending a question and to the second member it passes all these routers and so to a second member, to the third member, to the one who that has the answer and then, of course, once it has the answer it will send it immediately back because he knows the address of the inquirer. So that's basically a PEER-to-PEER and it basically bypasses the whole Internet by doing that. So now each of these computers act as a computer and as a router because it sent it to the next one with the tag and so on, okay? So that's the beauty of -- and now peer to peer is very big. It's really emerging. It started with Napster and now it's really emerging. Another thing is virtual private networks. If you belong to a company with the main office over there and you are traveling, or you have an office in some other place, and you want to send some very highly secret stuff from one place to another then what you do is you encrypt the addresses and so on inside the packet, okay? That's done still inside the IP encrypted and there are, again, routers that can interpret the encryption once it reaches there. So, it can go very safely through anywhere you are. For example, in my hotel I can connect to Boston University through VPN and it looks as if I'm at Boston University. So if I ask for a paper from a journal, I can download it because Boston University is a member. So this is another virtual network, okay? This is another overlay. Voice over the Internet is another overlay: the same idea. But they are all encumbered by the problem of having to follow a certain set of protocols. Cloud computing: This is another emerging technology and cloud computing; you basically have companies that do that, have a huge number of servers which are computers, and they can be in one place, or they can be distributed over very different areas and they are, again, connected by virtualization; by overlays, and if you are a business you don't have to buy the software and hire the IT people to run your business software. You can rent it on a cloud computer. You can store your stuff over there. You can do all your work over there and you don't need any overhead for computers. You basically have maybe one or two PCs without any software because the software resides over at the cloud computing company. You can develop; you can develop applications because cloud computing also provides all the tools to develop applications. Suppose you had your company and you want to develop a Web page for your company. You don't have to have all the software to do that. They can give you help and they basically -- you can design it with just your very simple computer with no programs on it. So virtualization is becoming a central feature of modern networks, in combination with virtualized computers. Infrastructure is extremely useful. Major shifts in focus for networking; we're moving from a traditional approach to a virtualization approach which eliminates the need for a single network. You can have, as I said earlier, you can have simultaneous networks, each one with its virtual routers and so on and so forth. This works in IP. This works in something else and so on. So that's the thing that virtualization -- it's a whole new world that virtualization opens. There are other things like now -- it's being researched and that's autonomic networks that can self-configure, self-optimize, self-protect, self-heal, self-monitor, self-adjust, and then you have self-governance of the network, okay? This is also -- this has not yet, has not yet emerged but it's in the process of research. And this is some more self-managing routing, forwarding, monitoring, discovery, fault detection, fault removal can all be -- can automatically feed to each other. It's exactly like a biological system. It feeds to each other. That idea of autonomic networks came around 2000 from IBM and it's, again -- they were worried about the fact that millions and millions and millions of lines of code are being written and at some point we’re going to reach the point where we can't deal with it; and therefore, we should think about having it self-governing and self-awareness, context awareness. You should be aware. Then they is user centric like Web 2.0 and so on. So all these emerging services and technologies are coming up and the question is: Can the current Internet handle that? And that has led to what we call mega-cyber network projects and these are huge projects. The main ones are the Global Environment for Network Innovation, GENI, which is funded by the NSF. GENI is a project that covers, as I'll show you on the map, covers the whole -- it's a whole new hardware network over the whole of the United States and it has 33 institutions, universities and research centers participating. The first phase is something like half a billion dollars and that's to establish this huge network, okay? And over this network they call them slices. Each research experiment group will have a slice which means they will basically exist virtually and they can do their own -- they can experiment with hardware, with software, with new applications, with new protocols, everything; and then there's a second one which is Future Internet Design. That is research done over the existing Internet. In Europe they have Future Internet Research and Experiment, FIRE. In Japan they have AKARI and NwGN. In Korea they have FIF, and China has CNGI. So all these countries have these mega-projects researching these. What is it going to be? Are they going to come out with something that says it's time to scrap the Internet and start from scratch? Or are they going to come up with something that says we can do it evolutionary and that's the question that still has not been totally answered. And this is the Internet. This is the GENI Internet; another picture of the GENI Internet. I'll stop here.

SPEECH: DOH062216
DATE: June 22, 2016
TITLE: Remarks by Deputy Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas at the 6th Annual International Cybersecurity Conference

TEXT: This morning I realized that this summer marks the 39th anniversary since my first visit to Israel—39 years ago I visited family, I worked on a kibbutz, and I toured the country. These past two visits over the course of the last year, I have visited in my official capacity, yet nevertheless, I feel just as much at home this past year now as I did 39 years ago. It is not only because of my family residents here in Israel or my love of this country, but importantly, because of the friendship and partnership that I have forged with a number of officials in the Israeli government, chief among them Dr. Matania, and I appreciate that and am grateful for that. I felt that I would just share a few thoughts about the landscape in the United States domestically in terms of our federal government’s efforts, speak a bit about the international forum in which we operate to discuss our cybersecurity challenges, and then to share with you what I deem to be an imperative for the future. Back home in the United States the federal government is in the process of really reorganizing itself to best meet the cybersecurity challenges that we confront. Significantly, the Department of Homeland Security has been placed in the point position, the tip of the spear if you will, on behalf of the federal government, not only to drive the security of federal government departments and agencies throughout the administration, but critically to be the point in a public-private partnership to ensure that the federal government and the private sector is working together to address a challenge that confronts us both. And in this regard, the critical architecture that we are developing is the architecture of information sharing. That is one of the edifices for the institutions we are building, and the second is a response protocol that is unique to the cybersecurity challenge. In normal criminal law, the focus of attention on behalf of the government is the identification and apprehension of the perpetrator to address the threat in the first instance. In the cybersecurity realm, we recognize that the identification and certainly the apprehension of the perpetrator can be so difficult. The perpetrator could be across the world. Cybersecurity as we know knows no boundaries, and importantly, therefore, it is critically necessary to ensure that we filtrate the harm, we remediate and repair it. And so, the ability to protect the asset in the cybersecurity realm could be more important than the apprehension of the wrong doer. And between those two architectures, the sharing of information and the response to the asset that is the target of a cybersecurity challenge, we are really building a new culture and a new institution in the federal government. We confront some challenges in doing so; the sharing of information between the private and the public sectors brings some challenges as I mentioned. First, at a very nascent stage, the industry, individuals, companies ask of us “What is really in it for us? What is the benefit for us to share information?” And the answer is in one of the unique natures of cybercrime that is the ease of replication. Just as a perpetrator victimizes one individual computer or institution’s system that harm can be replicated with ease and with tremendous speed. And so, the ability to share information with the government, so that the government, in its unique position, can disseminate the cyber threat information to others throughout the country will ensure the replication of the harm never materializes. And so, even though we are at a nascent stage in information-sharing architecture, I am confident because of our abilities and the capabilities we are developing that we will, indeed, instill this culture in the private and the public sector. The second obstacle that we confront, quite frankly, is the issue of trust. There is still a chasm of distrust between the private sector and the federal government. I, personally, believe that to some extent we still are operating as a federal government and, certainly, in the cyberspace. In the shadow of the Snowden disclosures of several years ago the question arises when an individual or an institution shares information: what will the government do with that information? And the legislation that Congress implemented at the end of 2014 and the policies that we have implemented since that critical piece of legislation provides adequate protection in that regard. In addition, there’s a concern about accountability. Some of our independent regulatory agencies have brought actions against institutions when those institutions have revealed inadequate cybersecurity process to protect shareholders, to protect customers, and to protect consumers more broadly. And so, the accountability regime in our country serves as a point of hesitation in an institution’s willingness to share information with us, and of course, there is the issue of civil liability not just government action but consumer litigation should the information provided reveal a level of negligence. This too, our legislation and our policies have guarded against. There is anonymity if one so chooses when providing information to the government, there is liability protection and there is a confidentiality of information once we in the Department of Homeland Security receive it. I think that our ability, our unique position to receive information and to disseminate it broadly really is a galvanizing force in the information sharing architecture that we see is critical to the future. There is one element to it from a market perspective that I would implore people to embrace. And that is the notion of a public good. Despite the threat indicator itself, now we can moderate the value that is in the marketplace. The cybersecurity industry has blossomed and has grown so significantly beyond the mere possession and dissemination of cyber threat indicator. That indicator need no longer be treated as a commodity and should be treated as a public good. If we share the cyber threat indicators with one another we can achieve our goals, the goals I previously articulated, and that is to ensure that our vulnerability, once discovered, is not twice exploited. And if, in fact, an institution shares that vulnerability with another, if one has been victimized we can ensure that the second and subsequent institutions that share that vulnerability are not similarly victimized. We must share information and specifically the cyber threat indicator to share and receive that result. One of the lessons, I think, what we have experienced in the cyber world is to go it alone is a very precarious endeavor, but to work together makes us all stronger and creates an ecosystem that will best protect us. That leads me to turn to the international arena. We enjoy an extraordinary close partnership with the State of Israel. Dr. Matania and I reached agreements in the past and we are, in fact, going to be signing an agreement together tomorrow to embark on an automated information sharing protocol together. And that is a capability that we in the Department of Homeland Security have developed the ability to receive information in automated form and disseminate it in near real time in automated form as well. And I say near real time because, critically, I spoke of the confidentiality provisions and the ability to protect privacy interests and that we are able to do in seconds and minutes. The cybersecurity threat is, of course, borderless. So, just as we proselytize the sharing of information domestically we proselytize it in the international arena as well. And information must be shared between and amongst countries through the computer emergency response teams in CERT-to-CERT relationships and otherwise. We must always also ensure that countries follow the well-established international norms. We are pleased that we were able to negotiate an agreement with the Republic of China to ensure that it abided by the international norms, and critically, the norm that it will not engage in cyber conduct to steal secrets for the commercial advantage of entities operating in its domain. And, of course, with respect to cooperation there is a critical need to share our research and development and to share our innovations of which Dr. Matania spoke. And in that regard, the United States and Israel share a strong bond and a very strong partnership. The United States with our remarkable resources, our technological innovation, and the dynamism of our tech community can certainly be a leader in cybersecurity across the globe. Our close partner and great ally, a much smaller country, Israel, is and can be as well. And I think that’s for a number of unique reasons, not just its extraordinarily brilliant individuals working not only in universities and government, but in the private sector in close partnership with those institutions, but also because of the architecture Dr. Matania spoke of and has developed. It is an extraordinary high priority of the prime minister and of the government as a whole to ensure that the cybersecurity is a result of tremendous investment of talent and funds to ensure the cybersecurity of the nation. It is, as Dr. Matania mentioned, a direct report to the prime minister which reflects the prioritization of this critical agenda. It is also, quite frankly, Israel’s position in the world as a leader, also quite frankly, because of the visionary leadership of Dr. Matania himself. I have had the privilege and the pleasure of working with Dr. Matania for well over a year now and I think he is one of the most thoughtful leaders in this face that the world has and we can all benefit from following the model of Israel and listening to and adhering to the vision of some of its leaders. The tech industry in Israel is growing by leaps and bounds, and it also has the unique ability to recruit talent through military service, through the identification of individuals with the talent needed to develop the cybersecurity of tomorrow. Israel, along with the United States and other nations, is poised to work as a collaborative partner to ensure that our ecosystem in a united way is stronger today and tomorrow. It is interesting, I spoke with a government official, a local government official in the United States, recently and one of the topics in our conversation was the question whether our security could keep pace with our technological innovations. We were remarking on the news that the virtual currency, Ether, had been victimized by a cyberattack despite the best of defenses. And the official asked me what we can do to make sure that the driverless car of tomorrow is secure given its reliance on technology and I impressed upon him that that tomorrow is already here, today. Last year, I spoke at a conference of hackers in Las Vegas, Nevada, a conference known as DefCon, and immediately preceding my remarks was the presentation of two individuals that hacked into a Chrysler automobile and took over its operating system. So, we cannot think that tomorrow is far away when we speak of the need to ensure that security keeps pace with technological innovation. That tomorrow is here. We are all gathered here today because of that reality. And if I leave you with one message, it is the message of the need for all of us to work together to make each of us stronger and more secure. Thank you very much.

SPEECH: DOH111915
DATE: November 19, 2015
TITLE: Remarks by Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh C. Johnson at Cybercon 2015

TEXT: I begin with something about Paris. As the President said the night they occurred, the terrorist attacks in Paris are not just attacks on the people of France; they are attacks on all of humanity and the universal values we share. Since Paris and in the days, weeks and months before then, we are doing a number of things to enhance the security of the U.S. homeland, and we continue to evaluate whether more is necessary. The FBI, under the leadership of Director Jim Comey, continues to do an excellent job of detecting, investigating, disrupting and prosecuting terrorist plots to our homeland. As always, the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI continue to be in close contact with state and local law enforcement. Since last Friday we’ve been providing them the very latest from our intelligence and law enforcement communities about what we know of the attacks in Paris. As always, the Department of Homeland Security is in touch with a number of organizations representing retail businesses, mass transit, critical infrastructure, professional and college sports and others. Within hours after the Paris attacks we reached out to all these groups to share with them what we know, and to hear what additional security measures they may be taking. I have personally been in touch with a number of big-city mayors to talk to them about the Paris attacks. In general, the posture across this country, after Paris, has been to reinforce existing security measures, and provide an enhanced security presence at a number of large public events and places. Particularly as we approach the holiday season, we continue to encourage the public to travel, attend public events, and freely associate, but remain vigilant and aware. “If You See Something, Say SomethingTM” is more than a slogan. There are other domestic security enhancements we have made in recent days, weeks, and months. Last year, following the terrorist attack in Ottawa, Canada, we enhanced our security presence at federal buildings around this country. Also last year, I directed additional security measures at airports overseas with direct flights to the United States. Those enhancements have been adopted as the new standard by many of the countries in which these airports exist. Though the investigation of the crash of Metrojet 9268 in Egypt on October 31 is not complete, several days after the crash I directed further aviation security enhancements at certain “last point of departure” airports in the region with respect to items on aircraft. To know more about those who travel to the United States from a country for which we do not require a visa – and many of those are European countries – at the beginning of this year, we sought more personal information from those who complete the Electronic System for Travel Authorization, or “ESTA.” These additions have already proven very effective. About half the denials for requests to travel here are attributable to these additional data fields. In August, I announced additional security measures we are seeking from countries from which we do not require a visa to travel here. These include the use of E-passport, more use of the Interpol database for stolen passports, and more use of Federal Air Marshals. Since I have been Secretary we have been proactive in engaging various communities in this country to help them identify and discourage anyone in those communities who may be turning toward violent extremism. I recently created an Office for Community Partnerships to take these efforts to the next level. This includes, by the way, engaging the tech sector to help those in Muslim communities in this country who need a larger platform and a louder microphone for their message to counter the dangerous messaging of extremist groups around the world. This is an urgent matter and a call for action. Within a short period of time, groups such as ISIL have become extremely effective at using the internet to recruit and inspire. We need your ideas and your help. As I said before, we continually evaluate whether more is necessary. Now I want to say something about refugees. The world faces an unprecedented outpouring of more than 4 million refugees from Syria. At present, over 2 million are in Turkey, over 1 million are in Lebanon, and an estimated 630,000 are in Jordan, 245,000 in Iraq, 127,000 in Egypt, and about 150,000 in Germany. A number of other nations, including our closest allies, have pledged to share some of this burden and accept Syrian refugees into their borders. For example, the new government of our neighbor to the north, Canada, has pledged to accept 25,000 Syrian refugees this calendar year. Meanwhile, our government has pledged to increase the number of Syrian refugees we will accept, from 2,000 last fiscal year to at least 10,000 this fiscal year. This represents a commitment by our government to accept 0.25% of the approximately 4 million Syrian refugees in the world. The United States can and should adhere to this commitment. It is important to note that the overwhelming majority of Syrian refugees we have accepted and will accept are women, children and families. Both the UNHCR and we have prioritized for resettlement the most vulnerable of Syrian refugees -- which means women, children and families who are the principal victims of the violence perpetrated by both the Assad regime and ISIL in Syria. Further, the process for vetting Syrian refugees prior to acceptance and resettlement in this country is very thorough, occurs in multiple stages, involves the State Department, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Health and Human Services, in consultation with our law enforcement and intelligence communities, and the process is time-consuming. It is the most thorough vetting process conducted with respect to anyone who crosses our borders. Especially during these tense times, it is useful to remember that terrorism cannot prevail if the people refuse to be terrorized. In our efforts to enhance the security of the homeland, we must not compromise our values as a free and open society. I can build you a perfectly safe city, but it will look like a prison. We can build more walls, install more invasive screening, interrogate more people and make everybody suspicious of each other, but not at the cost of who we are as a Nation of people who cherish privacy, value the freedom to travel and associate, and celebrate our diversity. The same is true of cybersecurity, which is the topic I originally came here to talk about. Cybersecurity also involves striking a balance. I can build you a perfectly safe email system, but your contact will be limited to about 10 people, and you would be disconnected entirely from the Internet and the outside world. This, too, would be like a prison – an information prison. The reality is we live in an interconnected, networked world. Cybersecurity must, therefore, also strike a balance between the basic security of online information and the ability to communicate with and benefit from the networked world. In the meantime, the reach and interconnectivity of the Internet is growing at a rapid rate. Today, there are more connected devices than human beings on this planet. In just five years the number of devices connected to the Internet is estimated to exceed 50 billion. At the same time, cyber threats are increasing in their frequency, scale, sophistication, and severity. The ranges of cyber threat actors, methods of attack, and targeted victims are also expanding. This affects everyone, both in government and in the private sector across the country and around the globe. Not a week goes by without a news report of another organization being hacked. These threats come from a range of actors, including nation-states with highly sophisticated capabilities, profit-motivated criminals, and ideologically driven hackers or extremists. Cybersecurity is a top priority for me, the President and this Administration. Indeed, I am determined to make tangible improvements to our cybersecurity before leaving office as Secretary. We are making aggressive strides in that direction. Today I’d like to make four points about cybersecurity: First, I congratulate both houses of Congress for passing cybersecurity legislation this year. Congress is actually getting some stuff done, and in a bipartisan fashion. On October 27, the Senate passed S. 754, the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015. Earlier this year, the House passed H.R. 1731, the National Cybersecurity Protection Advancement Act, and H.R. 1560, the Protecting Cyber Networks Act. All of these bills seek to codify important parts of the President’s legislative proposals for cybersecurity. These bills strengthen the role of the Department of Homeland Security in our Nation’s cybersecurity efforts. The Senate bill and the House Homeland Security bill both incentivize the private sector to share cyber threat indicators with the federal government through the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center, also known as our “NCCIC,” at the Department of Homeland Security. At the same time, we will ensure that any sharing regime optimizes the government’s ability to share cybersecurity threat information in the most effective and efficient manner. This is why we have been equipping the NCCIC to share this information rapidly and in automated fashion with other federal agencies, and to do so with appropriate protections for privacy. For the private sector, the principal incentive for information sharing in these bills is the limitation on civil and criminal liability. The legislation passed by the House and Senate also specifically authorizes DHS to deploy its intrusion detection and prevention system – called EINSTEIN – across the federal government. For reasons I will explain later, this technology is key to DHS’s efforts to protect federal civilian networks. I urge that Congress proceed to conference on the House and Senate bills as soon as possible, so that they can get to the President’s desk and become law. The action by Congress this year builds greatly on cyber legislation passed last year: the Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 and other laws that codify the role of the NCCIC as the federal interface for the private sector with DHS and provides DHS additional authority to hire cyber talent. With the help of Congress, therefore, we are strengthening our ability to protect the cybersecurity of the American public, American businesses, and the federal government. Second point: in connection with the visit of the President of China Xi Jinping in September, our two governments announced several commitments to address our differences on cyber issues. In September the United States and China committed that both states should increase law enforcement communications regarding malicious cyber activities, including breaches of sensitive information, and provide timely responses to requests for information and assistance concerning malicious cyber activities. Both nations agreed to provide updates to the other side on the status and results of these investigations and take appropriate action. The United States and China also committed to refrain from conducting or knowingly supporting cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property, including trade secrets or other confidential business information, with the intent of providing competitive advantages to companies or commercial sectors. Such a commitment was uttered by President Xi himself, in a speech he delivered in Seattle in September. Finally, as a means of ensuring that these commitments are upheld, we agreed to a regular Ministerial-level dialogue on these issues, involving, on the U.S. side, the Secretary of Homeland Security (that’s me) and the Attorney General. The first of these meetings will occur here in Washington on December 1-2. Last week, Deputy Secretary Mayorkas led a U.S. delegation to Beijing to meet with senior Chinese officials in preparation for these December meetings. Time will tell whether the Chinese government’s commitments in writing are matched by action. Our next round of meetings is on December 1 and 2 and they will be an important indicator. I intend to remain personally engaged on these issues. These commitments do not resolve all our challenges with China on cyber issues to be clear. But, they do represent a step forward in our efforts to address one of the sharpest areas of disagreement in the U.S.-China bilateral relationship. Third point: I have directed an aggressive timetable for improving cybersecurity for the federal civilian .gov network. As the OPM breach painfully demonstrated, our federal cybersecurity efforts are not where they need to be, but we are improving, by detecting and blocking more and more intrusions every day. To begin with, at DHS we recently made the first phase of our Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation program available to 97% percent of the federal civilian .gov. We met this milestone weeks ahead of schedule. This program, known as CDM, helps federal agencies identify and fix problems on their networks in near-real-time. Agencies are now working diligently to deploy CDM. Once fully implemented, CDM tools will monitor agency networks internally for vulnerabilities that could be exploited by bad actors that have breached the perimeter. Next, on October 31, we reached a major milestone in our efforts to automate our sharing of cyber threat indicators. Our system to send and receive this cyber threat information in near-real-time is now up and running. We are working with multiple agencies and private sector partners to expand the number of those sharing and receiving information through this automated system. As directed by the President in Executive Order 13691, on September 3 DHS announced the selection of the University of Texas at San Antonio as the standards organization to develop best practices for Information Sharing and Analysis Organizations. By supporting the development of these “ISAOs,” we will help companies -- regardless of size, location, and sector -- share information with their peers and with DHS. We have seen great success from the Binding Operational Directive that I issued in May, based upon the authority provided to me by Congress in 2014. This directive required agencies to promptly fix critical vulnerabilities identified by the NCCIC on their networks. Departments and agencies responded quickly. When I issued that Directive, we had identified 363 critical vulnerabilities across federal agencies. Of those, agencies have fixed nearly 99% of them. But we are discovering more critical vulnerabilities every day, and our numbers of vulnerabilities are still higher than I’d like (although far lower than the 363). I recently urged my fellow agency heads to remain vigilant and ensure that they keep up this critical effort to rapidly fix vulnerabilities on their networks. I have directed my team to dramatically accelerate the deployment of EINSTEIN 3 Accelerated, also known as “E3A.” I have told them to make at least one E3A security measure available to all federal civilian agencies by the end of this year. We now protect 47% of the federal government with E3A, and to date, we have blocked over 700,000 actions that were possible attempts to steal government data or disrupt government systems. E3A is the intrusion prevention portion of our broader EINSTEIN program, and has the capacity to both identify and block known malicious traffic. Significantly, E3A will serve as a platform for future technology to go farther in recognizing and blocking suspicious and unwanted intrusions. My fourth and final point: whether in .gov, .mil, .com, .edu or .org, perhaps the single most effective thing we can do to improve cybersecurity is actually pretty simple – raise the awareness of everyone who uses your systems to the dangers of spear-phishing. I will tell you that the most devastating attacks by the most sophisticated actors often start with a simple act of spear-phishing – the bad actor is let in by the naïve employee who opens an email or attachment he or she should not. And, once the bad actor is through the gate and inside the house, he can pose as a system administrator or anyone else and gain access to sensitive information. While big problems typically require large, complex and expensive answers, the answer to this particular big problem is pretty simple -- raise awareness. For example, one of my largest components sent out an email to all of its employees with a link to free Redskins tickets. This e-mail was in fact a mock spear-phishing campaign – and bore many of the telltale signs, such as an unusual “from” address and an embedded link. Those employees who clicked on the link received a follow up message to meet in a certain room for their free tickets. When they arrived, they received a briefing on proper cybersecurity practices. We must train our people to understand cyber risks and use best practices online. Our adversaries understand that human behavior can be exploited as a weakness. Along with deploying innovative technologies, we must also ensure that our employees, family, and friends contribute to our shared security. The Department of Homeland Security is taking steps to help develop the cyber workforce. Since 2010, our Science and Technology Cyber Security Division has funded the National Collegiate Cyber Defense Challenge, a college-level competition where teams of eight students compete against each other to defend a business network from persistent cyberattacks. Over 200 colleges participated in this year’s competitions. We have also partnered with the National Science Foundation to fund the Scholarship for Service CyberCorps program. This is a unique program that issues selected colleges and universities scholarship grants to attract students to the cybersecurity field. Graduates are then able to work for federal, state, or local governments. We, at DHS, have successfully hired many graduates from this particular program. And, earlier this year we launched the 2015 Secretary’s Honor Program Cyber Student Volunteer Initiative for current two– and four–year college students. More than 75 selected students completed volunteer assignments supporting the DHS cyber mission at department field offices in over 50 locations across the country. Through this initiative, created in April 2013, students gain firsthand experience applying their skills and exposure to the cybersecurity work performed across DHS. In addition to their assignments, selected students participate in mentoring and professional development events with DHS managers and senior leaders. In conclusion, there is no one silver bullet for cybersecurity. But we are moving forward urgently to address a shared problem. My goal for the remainder of this administration is for the entire civilian government to be covered by a common baseline of security provided through E3A and CDM, and to maximize the number of companies benefiting from cybersecurity information sharing with DHS. We will face more challenges ahead. But we are taking aggressive action and we are well on our way. Given my own experiences as a New Yorker and a Department of Defense official, I have said many times in speeches that the cornerstone of the Department of Homeland Security is counterterrorism. I recognize that cybersecurity must exist alongside counterterrorism as one of our top priorities, for the protection of the American people, American businesses large and small, and the federal government. Toward this goal, we at the Department of Homeland Security have made considerable progress, and we will continue on this path. Thank you very much.

TITLE: Remarks by Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas at U.S. Chamber of Commerce 4th Annual Cybersecurity Summit

TEXT: Good morning. Thank you very much Ann and thanks to all of you for allowing me to share a few thoughts with you. I want to start by quoting the astronomer and author Clifford Stoll who wrote the following in an article in Newsweek Magazine 20 years ago: “Visionaries see a future of telecommuting workers, interactive libraries and multimedia classrooms. They speak of electronic town meetings and virtual communities. Commerce and business will shift from offices and malls to networks and modems and freedom of digital networks will make government more democratic. Baloney. The truth is no online database will replace your daily newspaper, no CD-ROM can take the place of a competent teacher, and no computer network will change the way government works.” I’m sure he’s grateful he never bet on football. So obviously the cyber world directs, guides and supports us in so much of what we do, not only of course in the government but throughout the private sector and as Michael commented just a few minutes ago, the cyber threat is equally prevalent and only growing. And so what exactly do we do about it? There are a number of possible solutions. But the one thing I would like to focus on, the one effort that we care so deeply about in the Department of Homeland Security is the sharing of information. And information sharing raises a number of different questions and what I would like to do is share some thoughts with you with respect to each one. With whom do we share information? For what purpose? What is the value proposition of sharing information? And what is the guard against exposure? Let me first speak to the first question, with whom do we share information? And I think critically, one compelling answer is with each other. Michael spoke of the Information Sharing and Analysis Centers, which are sector-specific and by virtue of the President’s Executive Order earlier this year, we’ve also created the construct of the Information Sharing and Analysis Organizations which allow companies to share information with one another and raise their collective cybersecurity. And I know you hear from Tom Fanning, the Chief Executive Officer of one of the most prominent electricity companies in our nation, who I think is quite frankly is a leader in developing a cyber ecosystem within his sector and a prominent proponent of information sharing for the collective good. One of course shares with law enforcement, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the United States Secret Service, and in some instances Homeland Security Investigations. And then one has the option of sharing with the civilian part of the Department of Homeland Security. We are defined as a civilian department within the government architecture and we have our US-CERT and ICS-CERT teams, our computer response teams, and a center that works with the private sector in receiving and sharing information. For what purpose? Each one of these different elements of information sharing can serve a different purpose. Of course when one shares with law enforcement one is really dealing with the accountability mechanism, the function of government to investigate and prosecute the perpetrators and in the cyberspace this is very critical because the actor is traditionally not a one-time actor but a recidivist and the ability to hold an actor accountable prevents that actor from engaging in the same conduct in the future. The other is remediation. The curative effect. Cleansing the system. Patching the network. And hopefully guarding against the same harm inflicted on another occasion. And by the way these are not necessarily exclusive with one another but they are sometimes distinct in separate channels. And I think what I have sensed in speaking publicly on this subject of information sharing is that companies sometimes feel a tension with cooperating with enforcement on the one hand and perhaps cooperating within government’s remedial efforts on the other. And just as the private sector feels that tension, quite frankly the discussions are going within the government about that very same tension. In what instance and in what circumstances is it actually most effective in the service of the public to actually share information in the first instance with those authorities that can provide remedial resources and help a company or an industry address a threat from a patch and vulnerability exposure perspective? And what we are talking about within the government is actually developing an architecture for the delivery of a prioritization scheme and developing criteria that will help us within the government decide how best we collectively should respond to a particular incident and the consequences of each stream are sometimes distinct. The Administration has spoken and if one is aware of the Administration’s position with respect to the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act which is now working its way through the legislature. The Administration has said that the Department of Homeland Security should be the primary portal. The civilian department should be the primary portal and then it will disseminate the information it receives to its government partners for their discrete purposes. And one can see that in the discussion of the legislative language. The Administration supports the term, the Department will be through its NCCIC, the Department will be the portal rather than a portal and the Department is developing, we are developing the capability to share information across the government in near real time in an automated form. And therein lies another critical component of the legislative language, whether we share that information in real time or whether we share it in near real time. And the reason why we, and supported by the Administration, believe profoundly that that term “near real time” is so critical because it allows us to scrub in automated form personally identifiable information and other information that carries with it significant privacy interests that do not necessarily serve the discrete interests of the enforcement or investigative communities. And we will develop and we are developing that near real time information sharing mechanism in automated form but we will preserve the right to have the human eye evaluate those cases that present unique legal or other privacy challenges. And so, we, the Administration, believe that the Department of Homeland Security should be the portal. What is the value proposition? As I mentioned in the sharing of information of course one can bring an accountability regime to bear upon the perpetrator, but the real overarching goal from a public good perspective is the following: that the harm that one company suffers today will not be a harm that another company suffers tomorrow. Because the sharing of information with respect to the harm that befalls a company today, if one shares that information across one’s industry and even more broadly then the cyber threat indicator information will enable other companies to guard against that very same harm and to develop the defenses to prevent it from inflicting harm again. And that is how we raise the bar of the cyber hygiene ecosystem collectively. We actually advocate that the cyber threat indicator really should no longer be a commodity that is sold in the marketplace. There are many capabilities that could be sold for profit and of course so many of you engage in the acquisition of those resources and those capabilities. The defense, the perimeter defense mechanisms, the defense in-depth mechanisms, but the cyber threat indicator, if we can get to a place where those are not sold as unique commodities among limited partners but shared widely but as a public good we think the greater good will best be served. What exactly is the guard against public exposure? Many companies are hesitant to share information with the government because of the liability that could follow. Well of course the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act presents a legislative proposal that presents a liability protection for the sharing of information with the government. Certainly from a privacy perspective, I should share with you, that in the Department of Homeland Security when that information is shared with us in so far as it impacts critical infrastructure, we are actually prevented from releasing it under the Freedom of Information Act and also prevented from sharing it with regulators. And so liability protection that the current legislation captures is one way of guarding against exposure. If I can share with you a bit of commentary, I was a prosecutor for 12 years, a trial prosecutor in the federal system as an Assistant United States Attorney for nine years and as the United States Attorney for three, and so I’m very familiar with pursuing liability and seeking to impose liability before a trier of fact. In the cybersecurity realm, I observe something that I think is very odd to which I am not accustomed and I think some policy debate needs to occur more robustly around this following fact: that what I observed is an increasing pursuit of corporate liability for inadequate cybersecurity regimes within a company without there being yet a clearly defined standard of care. And that’s not necessarily true in every aspect of industry, but it is certainly true in quite a number of aspects and quite a number of sectors and business endeavors. It just seems odd to me that the crucible of the courtroom is the place where case by case a standard of liability will be defined. What is the necessary prerequisite to really engender a greater level of information sharing within the private sector and specific to our interests in the Department of Homeland Security? What will it take for us to really develop a culture where private industry feels comfortable, feels confident, and feels that value is added in sharing information with the government? I think that in the post-Snowden environment there is a chasm between the private sector and the government and that is a chasm of distrust and I think that what we have to do is we have to shrink that chasm and we have to build a bridge so that it really becomes a thing of the past. And until we overcome at least the level of distrust that exists or has existed over the past few years, I think we are going to have an uphill battle. And I will share with you, I spoke a few months ago in Las Vegas at a conference of ethical hackers and I know that conjures quite an image, but there were two things that they spoke of that they felt were militating against the development of a greater level of trust that I was asking for. One is the battle over encryption. We in parts of the federal government and certainly in the intelligence community and investigative community we call it going dark where we lose lines of communication that have a criminal purpose to them, or worse in terms of the public harm, a terrorist element to them and we lose the ability to see those communications and respond in a safeguarding manner. And that is deeply troubling to us. And at the very same time we understand the extraordinary value of encryption. We understand that encryption has been, is not a recent phenomenon, but is an avenue that has been built and is being built over many years and we understand its societal and public value. And so the battle around, and battle is too strong a word, but the debate around encryption has trust development ramifications that we need to work through. I think we, quite frankly, have well identified the challenge, have well identified the problem, but need still to develop a solution. Also and lastly the trust coefficient is not facilitated or strengthened by virtue of the Wassenaar Agreement, an international agreement that we signed to prevent the proliferation of cyber technology and cyber research and knowledge for improper purposes. And I think in trying to thwart a public harm, we created an architecture that imposes upon a public good, and the dissemination of research and knowledge in technology for good, for good purposes. And I think that we have to take a look at the Wassenaar Agreement and we are revisiting its scope and impact upon the interests that we seek to further and promote. My hope is that the legislation that is currently passing through Congress or working its way through Congress, passes and the trust deficit that we have experienced over the past few years is addressed favorably. And most critically, it is addressed through experience; through the experience of the private sector sharing information with the government, with the government being able to disseminate information broadly throughout the country, and everyone realizing through that experience that the government brings value to the collective cybersecurity of the corporate world, the private sector, and our nation as a whole. And it is through that experience and that value proposition that the trust grows throughout the weeks and the months and the years ahead. And with that I thank you very much for allowing me to share some thoughts with you. Thank you.

DATE: April 21, 2015
TITLE: Remarks by Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson at the RSA Conference 2015

TEXT: Thank you for inviting me to speak here today. I’m excited to be speaking at the largest cybersecurity conference in the world. Cybersecurity is a major priority for my boss President Obama. It is a major priority for his entire Administration. It is a top priority for the Department of Homeland Security. For me personally, as Secretary, advancing my Department’s cybersecurity capability is one of my top goals in office. The Department of Homeland Security was formed in 2002, in the wake of 9/11. Counterterrorism is our cornerstone mission. But, the reality is that in 2015, cybersecurity has become a mission of equal importance. My message to you today is this: government does not have all the answers or all the talent.  Cybersecurity must be a partnership between government and the private sector. We need each other, and we must work together. There are things government can do for you, and there are things we need you to do for us. In private law practice, where I have spent most of my professional life, I was a service provider to private clients. I bring that attitude to cybersecurity. I am enthusiastic and proud about the direction we are headed. Under the leadership of Under Secretary Suzanne Spaulding and Deputy Under Secretary Phyllis Schneck, the former chief technology officer at McAfee, we are building an agile and responsive cybersecurity capability. The Department of Homeland Security is the U.S. government’s central interface with the private sector in responding to and mitigating cyber threats. We are also responsible for the security of the federal civilian .gov world. Central to our efforts is our National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center, or the “NCCIC.” The NCCIC is a busy place. In Fiscal Year 2014 alone, the NCCIC received over 97,000 cyber incident reports from the private and government sectors, and issued nearly 12,000 cyber alerts or warnings. Almost continually, an NCCIC team is in the field, making what is in effect a house call on a company to assess a significant cyber incident and helping them fix it. For certain diagnoses, we bring in more doctors, from the NSA, the FBI, or other agencies, to assist. The NCCIC identifies numerous vulnerabilities. Last year, across dozens and dozens of departments and agencies of the U.S. government, we identified 265 instances of the Heartbleed vulnerability, and in a three-week period reduced them to two. Last year we helped the private and government sectors address Shellshock, BlackEnergy, Havex, BackOff Point of Sale, Lenovo SuperFish, and other vulnerabilities. My goal is to see the NCCIC move to an even higher and better level. I am in the hunt to hire a new NCCIC director. I am personally participating in efforts to find a recognized all-star in the cybersecurity field, and I believe we are going to hire such a person soon. We are realigning reporting relationships so that the NCCIC director has a direct reporting and information sharing line to me, the Secretary. This is the importance I place on the NCCIC in our cybersecurity mission. We are enabling the NCCIC to provide near real-time automated information sharing to the private sector. I have directed our team to go full throttle on this. As you know, cybersecurity is about speed. Last week the NCCIC deployed the capability to automate publication of cyber threat indicators in a machine-readable format. We reached this major milestone five weeks ahead of deadline.  Today we are sharing indicators with an initial set of companies and are in the process of adding others. Later this year, we will be in a position to begin to accept cyber threat indicators from the private sector in automated near real-time format. We have set up the NCCIC as your primary pathway to provide cyber threat indicators to the U.S. government. Yes, the government is trying to make it easy for you. Today I am pleased to announce that the Department of Homeland Security is also finalizing plans to open up a satellite office in Silicon Valley, to serve as another point of contact with our friends here. We want to strengthen critical relationships in Silicon Valley and ensure that the government and the private sector benefit from each other’s research and development. And we want to convince some of the talented workforce here in Silicon Valley to come to Washington. The new United States Digital Service provides the option for talent to flow and rotate between private industry and our government teams. This will build capacity on all fronts. I hope some of you listening will consider a tour of service for your country. Congress is poised to help us in cybersecurity. Late last year Congress passed the National Cybersecurity Protection Act, which codifies into law that the NCCIC is the federal civilian interface with the private sector for cybersecurity. Late last year, Congress also passed legislation to help DHS hire and pay a highly-skilled cybersecurity workforce. We want to go further. In January President Obama came to the NCCIC and announced that his Administration supports additional laws to establish the NCCIC as the primary portal through which the private sector should pass cyber threat indicators. To encourage the private sector to share cyber threat indicators with the NCCIC, the President also announced that we now support legislation that will provide protection from civil and criminal liability to those who share cyber threat indicators with the NCCIC. President Obama has proposed and supports a national data breach reporting system, in lieu of the existing patchwork of state laws on the subject. He has proposed and supports enhanced criminal penalties for cybercrime. But, we are not just waiting for Congress to legislate. The President has been active in issuing a number of executive orders and actions to strengthen cybersecurity. In February 2013, the President signed an Executive Order to promote information sharing and cybersecurity best practices, by the creation of the Department of Commerce’s “Cybersecurity Framework” and the Department of Homeland Security’s C3 voluntary program. In February 2015, the President signed an Executive Order directing the Secretary of Homeland Security – that’s me – to encourage the further development of private Information Sharing and Analysis Organizations, or “ISAOs.” In February the President also directed the creation of a Cyber Threat Intelligence Integration Center to be a national intelligence center that “connects the dots” related to foreign cyber threats. Just a few days ago President Obama signed an Executive Order which authorizes the Secretary of Treasury to impose financial sanctions on those who engage in malicious cyber-enabled activities that are a threat to national security, foreign policy, economic health, or the financial stability of our country. Two weeks ago I was in Beijing and met with the Minister of Public Security and the Minister of Cyberspace Administration of the People’s Republic of China. Though we have sharp differences with the Chinese Government, particularly when it comes to the theft of confidential business information and proprietary technology through cyber intrusions, we and the Chinese recognize the need to make progress on a range of cyber-related issues. As the two largest economies in the world, the U.S. and China have a vested interest in working together to address shared cyber threats, and making progress on our differences. We have therefore agreed to further cybersecurity discussions. I believe this will allow us to make progress on cybercrime and other shared threats. The Department of Homeland Security also has a major law enforcement role in cybersecurity. The Secret Service is known for the protection of our nation’s leaders. The Secret Service is actually a law enforcement agency, originally formed by Abraham Lincoln in 1865 to investigate bank crime. This mission has evolved over the years to include the investigation of cybercrime. In February of this year the Secret Service was the lead investigative agency responsible for bringing to justice one of America’s most wanted cybercriminal suspects, Vladimir Drinkman. Homeland Security Investigations is also involved in hunting down cybercrime. The United States Coast Guard is involved in cybersecurity – by working to protect our maritime transportation system – a system that contributes $650 billion annually to the Nation’s gross domestic product and sustains more than 13 million jobs – from cyber related threats. These are some of the things your government is doing in cybersecurity. Now, there are several things I ask you to think about. First, we are all only as strong as our weakest link. You know this, as well as I do.  The most sophisticated companies and government agencies with the best cybersecurity remain vulnerable to the most basic act of spear-phishing, if just one of our employees opens just one wrong email or attachment. The same is true of companies with whom you do business and are linked with on the internet.  There are wide differences in the level of sophistication in American business when it comes to cybersecurity. Yet we are all increasingly interconnected. This is why I am glad to see on the program for this RSA conference a session on “Combating Cyber Risk in the Supply Chain.” Those of us at this conference must leave here and encourage others to practice good “cyber hygiene.” Second, I want you to know that, when it comes to the government’s cybersecurity responsibility, I am determined to root out any turf battles between government agencies. I am encouraging my people within Homeland Security to work in a cooperative and selfless fashion with our interagency partners at the FBI, NSA, Defense, Treasury, Justice and Commerce. Now, finally, I have an ask: for your indulgence and your understanding on the subject of encryption. The Department of Homeland Security has both the cybersecurity mission and a law enforcement/counterterrorism mission for the American people. We have feet in both camps. I therefore believe I have a good perspective on this issue. The current course we are on, toward deeper and deeper encryption in response to the demands of the marketplace, is one that presents real challenges for those in law enforcement and national security. Let me be clear: I understand the importance of what encryption brings to privacy. But, imagine the problems if, well after the advent of the telephone, the warrant authority of the government to investigate crime had extended only to the U.S. mail. Our inability to access encrypted information poses public safety challenges. In fact, encryption is making it harder for your government to find criminal activity, and potential terrorist activity. We in government know that a solution to this dilemma must take full account of the privacy rights and expectations of the American public, the state of the technology, and the cybersecurity of American businesses. We need your help to find the solution. Homeland security itself is a balance – a balance between the basic, physical security of the American people and the liberties and freedoms we cherish as Americans. I tell audiences that I can build you a perfectly safe city on a hill, but it will constitute a prison.  Two days ago, at the 20th anniversary of the bombing in Oklahoma City that killed 168 people, I said that terrorism of any type cannot succeed if the people refuse to be terrorized. In the name of homeland security, we can build more walls, erect more screening devices, interrogate more people, and make everybody suspicious of each other, but we should not do this at the cost of who we are as a nation of people who cherish privacy and freedom to travel, celebrate our diversity, and who are not afraid. In the final analysis, these are the things that constitute our greatest homeland security. Thank you for listening to me.

TITLE: Remarks by Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson at the White House Cybersecurity Framework Event

TEXT: Cybersecurity is one of the most important missions of the Department of Homeland Security. Cybersecurity is a matter of homeland security. As I said in a speech last week, one of the key goals of advancing this Nation’s cybersecurity is building trust and relationships between the government and the private sector. Part of that effort includes heightening awareness about the cybersecurity threat, in plain and simple terms the public can appreciate. On April 16 of last year, someone carried out an armed, physical attack on an electrical substation in Northern California that provides power to the Silicon Valley and surrounding cities. The perpetrators used high powered rifles to fire shots at 17 large electrical transformers. With some sort of crude cutting device, they also severed two sets of telecommunications lines near the substation, in an attempt to prevent 911 calls and systems from alerting operators of the attack on the transformers. What the public needs to understand is that today the disruption of a critical public service like an electrical substation need not occur with guns and knives. A cyber attack could cause similar, and in some cases far greater, damage by taking several facilities offline simultaneously, and potentially leaving millions of Americans in the dark. One year ago today President Obama signed Executive Order 13636 (on critical infrastructure cybersecurity) and issued President Policy Directive 21 (on strengthening the security and resilience of critical infrastructure). The Executive Order called for the government to work with the private sector to develop a set of voluntary guidelines, or best practices, for improving cybersecurity. Over the last year, drafts of that set of guidelines were presented to our partners in government, the private sector and the privacy advocacy community for their input. After this extensive consultation, we are today making available to the full public this set of guidelines -- which we call the “Cybersecurity Framework.” And, so that the private sector may fully adopt this Framework, we are today also announcing the Critical Infrastructure Cyber Community (C3) -- or “C-cubed” -- Voluntary Program. We are announcing this program today, but it is also actually being stood up today. The C3 program gives companies that provide critical services like cell phones, email, banking, energy, and state and local governments, direct access to cybersecurity experts within the Department of Homeland Security who have knowledge about specific threats we face, ways to counter those threats, and how, over the long term, we can design and build systems that are less vulnerable to cyber threats. C3 is also available for immediate advice and assistance in the event of an actual cyber attack. The advantages of the C3 program is that it is provided by DHS at no cost, and is set up as a single point of access to cybersecurity experts across DHS for those who need help. For example, say a small bank is replacing its computer systems that contain the account records of its customers. The bank can now work with DHS before they even start the process of buying that new system and figure out how to set it up, and ensure that they have considered their cybersecurity risks. An example of the type of service being offered by DHS, that can be accessed through the C3, is something called the “Cyber Resilience Review,” which is a tool that helps organizations of all sizes evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of their cyber systems and conduct a risk-assessment at absolutely no-cost.  To date, DHS has already facilitated more than 300 of these assessments, both in-person and in coordination with owners and operators of critical networks -- helping everyone from banks to local governments identify and address weaknesses. Cybersecurity is a shared responsibility, and it boils down to this: in cybersecurity, the more systems we secure, the more secure we all are.  We are all connected online and a vulnerability in one place can cause a problem in many other places.  So everyone needs to work on this: government officials and business leaders, security professionals and utility owners and operators. I thank our many colleagues and friends for getting us to this point and we look forward to working with you to achieve the important goals before us today. Thank you.

TITLE: Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano's Opening Remarks at the Five Country Ministerial

TEXT: Welcome, Minister Clare, Minister Collins, Secretary May, and Minister Blaney, and thank you for the opportunity to host this Ministerial of our five countries. As allies and economic partners, our five countries have a successful history of cooperation in addressing issues – from increased security to facilitated movement of goods and people. We have a unique relationship with one another.  We are all are democracies, we share the same language, we have strong economies, and we also have engaged citizens who expect action and accountability from their governments. But we are also bound together by new and evolving threats – from transnational criminal organizations, and terrorism, to those seeking to damage or disrupt critical infrastructure and infiltrate the systems that control such networks. In response, we must develop new mechanisms to address these shared security, public safety, cyber, and other related challenges. This will help us increase the efficiency, effectiveness, and operational control of our authorities. And that is why this meeting is so important.  This Ministerial will emphasize the interconnectedness of our economies, networks, cyber, and immigration systems. And it will allow us to build on our progress to date, while deepening our partnership in a unified and strategic way. I hope this becomes the first of many more to come. Today’s meeting is focused on three topics – the Cybersecurity of Critical Infrastructure, Countering Violent Extremism, and Data Exchange Initiatives. While each topic holds its own challenges, they all require close collaboration in order to build our collective ability to identify and mitigate threats that transcend our physical borders. And we know that there are more issues ahead of us. I see the Five Country Ministerial as a singular forum in which cross-cutting issues will inform discussions on how our five countries can collectively achieve the optimal balance of mobility and security. And by developing common approaches to shared threats, we not only build on best practices and leverage our experiences, we do so more efficiently, and in a way that strengthens each other’s capabilities. Our continued cooperative approach toward homeland security also serves as a model for international collaboration. Working closely together, we have a unique opportunity and capacity to develop common international standards and approaches to security issues, and promote these among other foreign partners. So I look forward to working with you today, and to our continuing cooperation.  Thank you again for attending today’s Ministerial and for your ongoing partnership.

TITLE: Remarks by Secretary Janet Napolitano at San Jose State University

TEXT: Thank you for the introduction President Qayoumi. I'm happy to be here at San Jose State University, an institution which has produced many of the innovative thinkers and doers of the cyber age. It's no exaggeration to say that Silicon Valley – and indeed our society – would not look the same were it not for this campus. Some of our nation's great tech companies -- including Intel and Oracle – had their origins right here, in the minds of San Jose State students or alumni. By the way, I am an alumnus of Santa Clara University just down the road. So this is a bit of a homecoming for me, too. So it is entirely fitting that we chose San Jose State to summarize our current efforts to secure the cyber domain, including building a world-class cyber workforce at DHS. Of course, few of us need to be reminded of the impact that the cyber revolution has had on our lives. From the kitchen table to the classroom, from business transactions to essential government operations and services, cybersecurity is an issue that impacts all of us. Whether you checked your smartphone this morning to read the news or signed-on to your bank account online or used a GPS system to make sure you didn't get lost on your way here … we all rely on these devices and the networks on which they run. As more and more daily functions rely on digital systems, the importance and necessity of protecting our computers, mobile devices, and networks will only continue to increase. And this isn't just an issue for consumers. While the vast majority of the nation's cyber infrastructure resides in private hands, the national security and economic risks associated with these assets are so profound that their protection is of national importance. To minimize the risk of a successful cyber attack, we need everyone, including our industry partners, the general public, and yes, our partners in academia, to do their part. Evolving Threat Landscape. The cyber domain has become inseparable from our daily lives. And while this increased connectivity has led to amazing transformations and global advances across society, it also has increased the importance and complexity of our shared risk. Cyber attacks can be carried out by individuals, criminal and terrorist organizations, and even by nation states. They can exploit vulnerabilities in cyberspace to steal money, intellectual property, or information. In some cases they can disrupt, threaten, or destroy the availability of critical services such as electric power and running water. Cyber attacks have increased significantly over the last decade. Indeed, they have increased significantly over the three-plus years I've served as DHS Secretary. Threats in the cyber domain encompass a broad range of activities, from targeted spear-phishing attacks, to malware, to denial of service, to intrusions into the control systems of government networks and systems that manage critical infrastructure. Here is a quick sense of scale. Just last year, DHS's U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT), which is our 24 hour watch and warning center, responded to more than 106,000 incident reports, and released more than 5,000 actionable cybersecurity alerts and information products to our public and private sector partners. We should not assume that attacks target only our government or corporate networks either. These crimes can have real-life victims and human consequences. We've all heard of hackers stealing credit card numbers, and other types of banking and financial fraud. But we also face cybercrimes that include the exploitation of children. Last year, for example, Attorney General Eric Holder and I announced charges against 72 individuals for their participation in an international criminal network dedicated to the sexual abuse of children and the creation and dissemination of graphic images and videos of child sexual abuse. A number of these were children under age 12, some much younger. The DHS Mission in Cyberspace. So how do we address these threats? Moreover, how do we address them across a distributed network that is largely controlled by the private sector, and yet, touches every single one of us – from large companies to individual users of the Internet? We do it by fostering a culture of shared responsibility, engaging all levels of society, and working with key stakeholders to make cyberspace as safe and secure as possible. DHS has some very important responsibilities with respect to cybersecurity. While the Department of Defense has the responsibility to protect the military – or dot.mil – networks, DHS is responsible for securing federal civilian government networks – the dot.gov domain –in partnership with federal agencies. To protect these networks, we are doing a number of things: We are deploying programs to detect and block intrusions of government networks. The reason is clear: the faster we can detect an intrusion – or even an attempt – the faster we can respond to it and therefore mitigate any potential damage. But we are planning to do even more. In fact our Fiscal Year 2013 budget includes significant new funding to support federal civilian departments and agencies in developing capabilities that will improve their cybersecurity posture and thwart advanced, persistent cyber threats. In addition, DHS is responsible for coordinating the national response to significant cyber incidents and for creating and maintaining a common operational picture for cyberspace across the government. This means making sure our nation has a well-conceived, coordinated plan for how we respond to a major cyber attack. Over the past few years we have worked across government and with the private sector to develop the nation's first Cyber Incident Response Plan, which defines roles and responsibilities, and which we have used as the basis for two national exercises. In addition to protecting civilian government networks, DHS must also work with owners and operators of critical infrastructure to help them secure their own networks by conducting risk assessments and then recommending actions to fill gaps and mitigate risks. "Critical infrastructure" means key systems and assets upon which Americans rely, such as the financial sector, the power grid, water systems, and transportation networks. As I noted, we share threat information with the private sector through US-CERT to help raise overall awareness of potential cyber threats and the actions we can take to address them. To combat cyber crime, we also leverage the skills and resources of DHS components such as the Secret Service, ICE, and CBP, and we work closely with the FBI on individual cybercrime investigations. Last year, for example, the Secret Service led an investigation that identified a person who had breached a Federal Reserve Bank computer server as part of a scheme to commit fraud. After analyzing this individual's computer, we found credit card data worth about $200 million. And on Cyber Monday 2011, one of the busiest online shopping days of the year, ICE and our partners shut down 150 websites selling counterfeit goods. Our work extends internationally as well. In today's high tech security and commercial environments, we have to focus beyond just the physical movement of goods and people across our borders. We are working with our international law enforcement partners to share expertise and resources to combat electronic crimes such as identity and intellectual property theft, network intrusions, and a range of financial crimes. For example, the Secret Service has Electronic Crimes Task Forces in Rome and London, and, now, a new office in Tallinn, Estonia, to help counter cyber crime originating from Eastern Europe. Need for Legislation. As much as we are doing, we must do even more. To this end, Congress has before it several pieces of proposed legislation designed to address emerging cyber threats. The proposal the Administration supports is a bipartisan bill sponsored by Senators Lieberman, Collins, Rockefeller, and Feinstein, and is known as the Cyber Security Act of 2012. Under current law, Congress gave DHS significant cyber authorities, and we inherited a patchwork of others. But we've reached a point where the current threat outpaces our existing amalgam of laws, and so we are working with Congress to make some changes to the law. Specifically, the Cyber Security Act of 2012 would establish baseline performance standards for the nation's critical core infrastructure. This is infrastructure that all of us – every business, every household, every individual – rely on every day: our utilities, financial institutions and communications systems, to name just a few. The legislature would leave to the infrastructure owners themselves the decisions as to how to satisfy those performance standards. It removes barriers to information sharing between the federal government, industry, and state, local, tribal and territorial governments in order that we may more quickly respond to and mitigate any cyber threat or intrusion. And, importantly, the legislation would help us attract and retain cybersecurity professionals to execute this complex and challenging mission by adding flexibility to the current personnel laws. The other approaches don't provide the comprehensive set of tools we need to protect critical networks, and actually undo progress that has already been made. For instance, relying solely on voluntary information sharing without establishing basic standards for core critical infrastructure will simply not be sufficient. I know that some have argued that the market is adequately adjusting to cybersecurity threats, vulnerabilities, and risks. But the current market incentives for security are simply out of line with the level of cyber risk, and the increasing sophistication of cyber attacks. Need for a Cybersecurity Workforce. That leads me to my next point, which is how we can more broadly engage each of you – students, educators, researchers, engineers, and the larger academic community – in our nation's cybersecurity efforts. To meet the challenges I've discussed, DHS needs a world-class cybersecurity team – a strong, dependable pipeline for the future. And I'm here today to tell you how we are building that team. Through our Cybersecurity Workforce Initiative, we are hiring a diverse group of cybersecurity professionals to secure the nation's digital assets, critical infrastructure, and key resources. That includes computer engineers, scientists, analysts, and IT specialists. In fact, since Fiscal Year 2008, our National Cyber Security Division has grown by more than 600 percent. And President Obama has asked Congress for a 74 percent increase in the DHS cyber budget in Fiscal Year 2013, recognizing the national needs in this arena. We are also building strong cybersecurity career paths within the Department, and in partnership with other government agencies. To accomplish this critical task, we have created a number of very competitive scholarship, fellowship, and internship programs to attract top talent. And to retain, and continually train, our top talent, we're moving quickly to create growth opportunities for our cyber staff. Just last month, we launched a pilot program with the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterrey through which a select group of employees can earn a Master's of Science in Cyber Systems and Operations via distance learning. That's just one example of a robust effort at DHS to engage and partner with colleges and universities, as well as the private sector, across the country. And I'm happy to say we have a great connection to San Jose State University through our sponsorship of the U.S. Cyber Challenge. The U.S. Cyber Challenge is a program that works with academic and private sector partners to identify and develop cybersecurity talent to meet our growing needs. One part of the Cyber Challenge involves intensive summer camp experiences for the best and brightest cyber talent. And San Jose State University will be hosting one of these camps this August for 100 lucky students. These students will participate in training sessions and exercises on topics ranging from network intrusion detection to forensics. Classes will be taught by leading industry professionals, faculty members from various universities, security practitioners across industries and the U.S. government. The camp will culminate with a "capture the flag" competition in which campers use their newly acquired knowledge to battle live attacks from hackers. Not only exciting, but a lot different from the camps I remember! DHS is also supporting Centers of Academic Excellence around the country to cultivate a growing number of professionals with expertise in various disciplines, including cybersecurity. We are extending the scope of cyber education beyond the federal workplace through the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education – or NICE - to include the public, as well as students in kindergarten through post-graduate school. And we have launched a DHS Loaned Executive Program designed to attract top professionals in the scientific and cyber fields. And if I can make a pitch: DHS is a great place to come to work to help move this vision forward. We are a new department. It is a place where all of us – including you have the opportunity to make a positive impact for your country. We see these opportunities not just as promising careers, but as opportunities to contribute to something larger – to contribute to public service. DHS needs more people like you to join a new generation of Americans in the fight against the new generation of threats to our homeland. Cybersecurity as a Shared Responsibility. All of us, from the most casual internet users to the most highly-trained experts, share in the responsibility to learn about cybersecurity and to do more, individually and collectively. We need industry to redouble its efforts to increase the reliability and quality of the products that enter the global supply chain. We need primary and secondary schools to teach safe online habits to students from an early age. And we need colleges and universities to make cybersecurity a multidisciplinary pursuit so that we have policymakers who understand technology, and also technologists who understand policymaking. It should not be unusual for a top computer scientist to take leave from academia or the private sector and spend a couple of years in government – hopefully, at DHS – working on solving important technological problems. Perhaps, most importantly, we need the general public to be more aware of the threats unsafe cyber behavior poses to our way of life, as well as more knowledgeable about where to get information to protect themselves. In 2010, we launched a national campaign – "Stop|Think|Connect" – to cultivate the basic habits and skills that everyone should adopt to keep our cyber networks safe. Our message begins with a simple concept: to ensure cybersecurity for all of us, each of us must play our part. We know it only takes a single infected computer to potentially infect thousands and perhaps millions of others. Everyone should make basic cybersecurity practices as reflexive as putting on a seatbelt – using antivirus software, being careful which websites you visit, not opening emails or attachments that look suspicious. These basic measures can improve both our individual and our collective safety online. Conclusion. Our nation has come together to meet great challenges before. During WWII, when our economy was mobilized for war, the American people found a way to feed themselves by growing 40 percent of all the vegetables we needed in 20 million Victory Gardens. In the early years of the Cold War, Americans all knew where the closest fallout shelter was, and we kept children indoors when polio outbreaks were the biggest threat to public health. In those times, Americans understood what was at stake; they understood that they had to contribute; and they knew that their efforts would make a difference, in ways large and small. But we're confronting some new realities here and we need some new thinking and new energy. Together, we can – and we will – maintain a cyberspace that is safe and resilient, and that remains a source of tremendous opportunity and growth for years and years to come. As the Secretary of Homeland Security, I strongly encourage you to join us as we pursue our mission … because it is urgent, it is worthwhile, and it will undoubtedly impact our nation's economic vitality and way of life for generations. As I look out into an auditorium of students, educators, and professionals, I am encouraged by your enthusiasm for these issues and am convinced that we must draw on your tremendous creativity, energy, and optimism to do something unlike what we've ever done before. These are complex and long-term challenges. That should not be a reason for despair, however. It should motivate us to work and think and collaborate in new ways. Albert Einstein once said, "It's not that I'm so smart. It's just that I stay with problems longer." That hints at the determination we must bring to one of today's hardest challenges. And I'm proud that DHS is welcoming talented individuals right now with that kind of determination … while offering an opportunity to serve our nation as well. Thank you.

TITLE: Secretary Janet Napolitano's Remarks at the Michigan Cyber Security Summit/National Cyber Security Awareness Month Kick-Off Event

TEXT: Thanks for the introduction. Good morning everyone. I want to extend my thanks to Governor Snyder and the State of Michigan for hosting this event, to highlight the importance of cybersecurity and the partnerships that are so critical to building our nation's cyber resiliency. I also want to thank the National Cyber Security Alliance and the Multi-State Information and Analysis Center for all you've done to elevate cybersecurity awareness here in Michigan and across our country. And it's also good to see my friends Representative Dingell, Representative Rogers, and Howard Schmidt here today, all strong partners and proponents of our cybersecurity efforts at the Department of Homeland Security and across government. In addition, I know we have a number of students and student groups here in the audience, including Digital Inclusion, Ann Arbor Teens for Kids, and students from Eastern Michigan University. Thank you for coming and also for doing your part in schools and communities to improve cyber awareness and security. Finally, I want to thank all of the cyber security professionals who have joined us here today. Your expertise is critical to our ability to address the emerging and evolving threat that we as a nation face in cyberspace. Importance of Cybersecurity/Shared Responsibility. Today we're here to kick-off National Cyber Security Awareness Month and highlight the Stop.Think.Connect. campaign. Together, these initiatives highlight the role that each of us must play in securing cyberspace. Few of us need to be reminded of the impact cyberspace has on our lives. From the kitchen table to the classroom, from business transactions to essential government operations and services, cybersecurity is an issue that touches all of us. Whether you checked your smartphone this morning to read the news or signed-on to your bank account online or used a GPS system to make sure you didn't get lost on your way here, we all rely on these devices and the networks on which they run. As more and more daily functions rely on digital systems, the importance and necessity of protecting our computers, mobile devices, and networks will only continue to increase. And this isn't just an issue for consumers. While the vast majority of the nation's cyber infrastructure resides in private hands, the national security and economic risks associated with these assets are so important that their protection requires a close partnership between government and the private sector to protect and defend them. We need everyone, including our industry partners and the general public to do their part, which is why events like the 2011 Michigan Cyber Summit are so important. And I'd like to take a moment to applaud the State of Michigan and the Governor for the steps you're taking to enhance cybersecurity. That includes launching a comprehensive cyber security initiative to help protect families, communities, businesses, and government. Michigan is also a leader when it comes to providing cyber security information and tools to business and the public, and creating a culture of cybersecurity through educational programs and public-private partnerships. Along with citizen engagement and action, we need a growing and dedicated field of experts – like many of you in this room – who can help us bridge the security gaps that exist, protect our critical cyber infrastructure, and create a more resilient culture when it comes to the web. NCSAM/Stop.Think.Connect. National Cyber Security Awareness Month gives DHS and its public and private sector partners an annual platform to remind the public of the importance of cybersecurity. The month of October will focus on several key areas that are essential to achieving our cybersecurity mission: The urgent need to develop and enhance cyber education programs to train tomorrow's cyber workforce. We need our nation's best and brightest working to address evolving cyber threats, and that requires strong education programs as well as a pipeline to employment in cyber-related fields. National and local efforts to prevent identity theft and other cyber crimes. Today, the same systems we use to download music, book travel, or pay our bills are targets for criminals seeking to steal identities or facilitate illegal activity. We all need to do our part to create a safer cyberspace that ensures the integrity of on-line transactions and helps prevent cybercrime. And we will focus on strategies that small- and medium-sized business owners can use to bolster their own cybersecurity defenses. It is also crucial that we remind all Americans about the importance of taking collective action to protect these systems from accidental or deliberate attacks and disruptions. As leaders in this field, many of you have a trusted voice to bring to this conversation – and I urge all of you to help us spread the word about personal cyber security. DHS and Federal Actions. To do our part, DHS is building our national operational capabilities and deploying sophisticated cybersecurity technology in defense of our federal departments and agencies. At DHS, our operational cybersecurity mission is two-fold: We are responsible for securing unclassified networks for Federal Executive Branch civilian departments and agencies (the .gov domain). We also work with owners and operators of critical infrastructure and key resources to support cybersecurity preparedness through risk assessment, mitigation, and incident response capabilities. Over the past two and a half years, we have worked closely with our partners to enhance the federal government's capacity to protect against cyber threats in a number of ways. We have prioritized the protection of the nation's Critical Infrastructure and Key Resources by emphasizing the connection between physical and cybersecurity. In plain English, this means recognizing that what happens in the digital world of cyberspace increasingly impacts the physical world of buildings and factories and transportation systems, and vice versa. They are part and parcel of each other, and we must protect both together. For this reason, we have implemented a comprehensive program designed to assist in the protection of the industrial control systems that help operate our power grid, manufacturing systems, and other essential components of our society. We are now working with thousands of security professionals and partners to promote good cybersecurity practices, conducting assessments, and publishing tools to assist facility owners in identifying vulnerabilities. And we are fielding Industrial Control System Cyber Emergency Response Teams (ICS-CERT) that can be quickly deployed to assist critical infrastructure owners and operators in evaluating attacks and preventing intrusions from escalating. Critical to many of these capabilities is the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC), which serves as the nation's principal hub for organizing cyber response efforts and maintaining a common operational picture for key stakeholders. These assets, combined with other resources from law enforcement, the intelligence community, state, local and tribal governments, and the private sector, provide better situational awareness and a central platform to address threats to civilian government networks and our nation's critical infrastructures and key resources. But we're not only making sure that federal networks are secure; we are also working with public, private, and academic partners, like those of you assembled here, to promote cybersecurity awareness. And we're looking to the future to be sure that we're prepared for evolving cyber threats. The DHS Science & Technology Directorate is leading efforts to develop and deploy more secure internet protocols that protect consumers and industry internet users. DHS remains committed to building and sustaining a world-class cybersecurity team by hiring a diverse group of cybersecurity professionals, including computer engineers, scientists, and analysts to execute this complex and challenging mission. Through the Cybersecurity Workforce Initiative, DHS is working with universities to build a cadre of cybersecurity professionals through competitive scholarship, fellowship, and internship programs to attract top talent in this field. Finally, we're working with Congress to pass legislation that would improve the overall cybersecurity posture of federal departments and agencies that Americans rely on for various services. This legislation also would enhance collaboration with the private sector by authorizing a combination of voluntary and mandatory programs to protect critical infrastructure, while removing barriers to information sharing. We delivered a proposal to Congress seeking these goals and we're looking forward to working with them to move it forward. What You Can Do. At the end of the day, however, cybersecurity is really about people. The most impressive and sophisticated technology will be worthless if it's not operated and maintained by informed and conscientious users. That is why at DHS we have continued to develop educational programs for those who are already working in cybersecurity as well as those who are still in school. We have made it a priority to provide those on the front lines with the information, tools and resources necessary to reduce the cyber risk to our nation. But while we've made significant advances, more needs to be done –and we need your help. We need your voices and your support as we work to spread the word about cyber security. What we are asking you to help communicate is simple: by taking a few basic steps to keep yourself and your family safe online, everyone can help secure cyberspace. That is the message of the Stop.Think.Connect. campaign. And anyone can start today by incorporating responsible behaviors into your daily life. For example: Keep your operating system and browser up-to-date, and learn about their security features; Choose strong passwords, keep them confidential, and change them regularly; Don't open unknown email attachments; and Review the privacy settings of social networking sites, cell phones, and other social tools you and your children use. Each of us must Stop and Think about cybersecurity before we Connect. For many of you, these practices are already a part of your daily routine, but we need to encourage this type of security thinking for every American. As I have said many times before, homeland security begins with hometown security; and that saying certainly applies to our increasingly interconnected online community. Every compromised computer—at home or at work—can potentially be used by those who would do us harm. If each of us become more aware of cybersecurity risks and implements a few easy steps on our home and business computers, we can make a big difference. Conclusion. So we hope you will help us continue to spread the word about the risks associated with cyber activity and how to stay safe online. That includes remembering three simple words the next time you log on to your computer: Stop.Think.Connect. Stop—because going on-line is an everyday activity that poses risks. Think—because the power to prevent cybersecurity problems resides with each of us. Connect—because cyberspace has become a resource with incredible benefits for our society and tremendous untapped potential for learning, entertainment and economic development. And after we ensure that our computers are safe and secure throughout October, let's continue to protect them throughout the year. Thank you for your commitment and dedication to this critically important issue. And thank you for your continued partnership as we protect our nation's cyber systems and networks.

SPEECH: DOH121710
DATE: December 17, 2010
TITLE: Remarks by Secretary Napolitano at the Atlantic's Cybersecurity Forum

TEXT: Good morning. I'm happy to report it's snowing very hard right now, so that's the weather report from outside this room. But that makes it all the more wonderful to be inside, and to be with you today. So thank you for having me. Thank you for convening on this important subject. We have been spending a lot of time on cyber issues at the Department of Homeland Security. And indeed, across the administration, we have, in my judgment, made a lot of progress this past year in terms of building the capability necessary to manage cyber incidents at the national level. And over the past year, we have seen the full spectrum of cyber threats, from spamming to the now service attacks, and attempts to inject dangerous pieces of spyware, among other things. So I think there is a clear recognition of the size and scope of the challenge involved in securing cyber networks, and by extension — and this is where DHS gets involved — securing the critical infrastructure of the country. So I think in addition to that recognition, there is also a more profound understanding of the kinds of partnerships that are necessary to deal with the cyber challenge. So what I'd like to do this morning is to take a step back and discuss, in a somewhat broad way, how we see the cyber challenge at the Department, and how we are approaching that challenge. First, let me say from the start, we really get it. Indeed, the Department this year produced its first-ever Quadrennial Homeland Security Review. And in that review — the Department is turning 8 years old in March, so in terms of institution building, it's still relatively young. And it was an amalgam of 22 different agencies that were all put under the umbrella and called the Department of Homeland Security. One of the things we did through the QHSR project was to say, what are our fundamental missions at Homeland Security. Counterterrorism, obviously, that's why we were founded; securing our borders, and that's air, land, and sea, makes sense; enforcing our nation's immigration laws, which we have done, and actually we removed from the country, more people in the last two years than any two years in our nation's history, in terms of enforcement. But the next major mission area was the protection of cyberspace. And these are not in order, per se. These were just to pick five major mission areas; counterterrorism, priority; but securing the borders; immigration enforcement; protection of cyberspace; and then the ability to respond to, and mitigate, and be resilient to disasters of whatever type when they occur. So the fact that cyberspace was specifically singled out in the QHSR process, amongst the myriad other issues that are within the Department of Homeland Security, I think indicates the fundamental understanding that we have on the importance of the problem. Secondly, it is our goal to build one of the very best teams that we can to tackle this cybersecurity challenge. This has got to be a team effort. It's within the Department, but no single agency or industry, quite frankly, can manage it. And so we need, at the Department, to have highly skilled, highly creative, highly dedicated men and women who are ready to come and meet and really think through what the nation needs by the way of cyber protection. By the way, if any of us, or any of you know anyone who is highly skilled and wants to come serve their country, I will take their résumé after this discussion. Finally, I want to stress that cybersecurity isn't about control. It's not about government control. It is about partnerships. But partnership needs to have some effectiveness. There needs to be meat on the bone when we say partnership. And there needs to be widespread distributed action toward that goal, so that we view this much more as creating, if I may, layered security involving partnerships, as opposed to top-down or government-down. So we are working more closely than ever to identify the private sector partners who we need, and work with them, and also across the federal family. Indeed, just this past fall, I signed, I think, a landmark agreement with Secretary Gates to better align our resources and actions, because the two of us recognize that between the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Defense, you have 90 percent plus of the cyber equities in the federal family. And if you look at the President's cyber review and where responsibilities were assigned, on the civilian side, it's DHS, and on the military side, it's DOD. Not only did we assign that, but we have cross-assigned individuals, and through that agreement, have identified how the technology resource base of the NSA will be employed, both on the military side, but, importantly, on the civilian side. And, indeed, for the first time ever, we have individuals who are now stationed at NSA, including, by the way, legal counsel and privacy officers, because there are particular protections that need to be applied in the civilian context. And that gives us the ability to tap into that incredible resource. And as I said before, we're also engaging with private industry and the general public, in what I think are some really novel ways. So that is all happening. At the same time, I recognize, and our Department recognizes, that much more needs to be done in this critical area, and that there needs to be not just a broad-base national commitment, but we need to actually be working together to create a national culture that provides that users at every level know that they are part of a system, know what they need to do to help us protect security, and have greater confidence, indeed, in the security of the system. So we need to build a cyber system in which the distributed nature of cyberspace becomes a great benefit, not a great weakness, and where people at all levels understand the shared responsibility that goes into that concept. It means that users, businesses, the technology industry, the government, everybody, has a role to play. We have to do our own part in the federal government. We must secure our own systems, and we are working to get that done, but we also must assist the private sector in securing itself and in enforcing the law, and indeed, I think laying the policy foundations for the future. For example, we need, I believe, a more transparent and inclusive cybersecurity policy-making process that brings the best minds to the table and the best minds from a number of different areas. We need colleges and universities to make cybersecurity a multi-disciplinary pursuit so that we have policymakers who understand technology, but we also have technologists who understand policymaking, and we get rid of that divide that currently exists. Now, there are some who say that cybersecurity should be left to the market. The market will take care of it, and there are some who characterize the Internet as a battlefield on which we are fighting a war. So it's the market or the war. Those are the two analogies that you hear. Not surprisingly, I take a different position. In my view, cyberspace is fundamentally a civilian space, and government has a role to help protect it, in partnership with responsible partners across the economy and across the globe. So let me just say that again. In my judgment, both the market and the battlefield analogies are the wrong ones for us to use. We should be talking about this as, fundamentally, a civilian space and a civilian benefit that employs partnerships with the private sector and across the globe. So we're proud to be a part of that global effort. We believe in the importance of an open Internet, but we cannot have an Internet that is open, but not secure, nor an Internet that is secure but not open. And I think just by saying that, that lays down the challenge that we confront. Now, the challenge is unique, and it's uniquely urgent. Cyber really equates to life's essential functions now. You can't imagine operating without cyber. A major disruption of our cyber networks could have cascading effects, not only within the cyber domain, but across multiple other sectors and elements of our critical infrastructure, crippling commerce, disrupting other aspects of Americans' daily lives. And because the cyber domain is so widely distributed, every single user becomes a consumer and a contributor, but also a potential source of security or insecurity. And that goes to the point I was making earlier, that every single user in this civilian cyberspace has a role to play in its security. Our mission is to make sure that we assist in that, that we see cyber as part and parcel of a secure homeland, not something separate or distinct from every other mission that we have. So first, we are working to create a safe, secure, resilient cyber environment. We're taking action to protect federal civilian networks, to improve our intrusion detection capabilities, and to create more robust and resilient systems that can withstand attacks, and also help prevent attacks from occurring. Now, there has been some real progress in this past year. We've had progress deploying EINSTEIN 2 across federal agencies in civilian space. We have released and tested a version of the National Cyber Incident Response Plan, the NCIRP, to enable us to respond as one nation, across the public and private sectors, to cyber incidents. We have opened and are now growing the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center, also known as the NCCIC, and that is a 24/7 watch and warning center. And we are holding the National Cybersecurity Challenge to bring the expertise and creativity of the public and the private sectors to bear in promoting cybersecurity. We have also in this past year I think expanded our partnerships with the private sector to protect our nation's critical infrastructure. The ones I would specify is working with are chemical plants, communication systems, and the control systems that operate our electric, water, and other utilities, including deploying teams to work with and to respond to cyber incidents that have involved critical infrastructure. We have made progress by building ourselves, our expert team of cyber professionals, to lead this work. DHS Deputy Undersecretary Phil Reitinger has nearly tripled the size of the National Security Division cyber workforce this year over last year. And last year, we doubled it over the year before. So we're moving in the right direction. And as I said before, if you know of individuals, we are actively recruiting people to serve their country. We are also working to promote cybersecurity awareness, education, and innovation; educating the public with information they need about cyber threats, that enables us to strengthen our collective defense, and also making sure that industry, as I said, is actively involved in our efforts. Now, I think it's fair to say that we need to be engineering some fundamental changes to Internet security. Cybersecurity must be a core component. It must be integral from the start, not something that's added on at the end; oh, we built this really cool thing, and it can do this really cool stuff, and now it's out there and it's really cool, and, oh by the way, we've got to do something about keeping it secure. No. You have to consider this as a core competency within the build-out of the Internet itself. So in that, the domain of cyberspace, in a way, requires a redesign or perhaps a fundamental shift in approach so that it is safe and secure from the outset. And it's a place where a vibrant and open international economic and social order can thrive. That's why we think informing and engaging the public is important. That's why we believe our National Cybersecurity Awareness Campaign, underway now, which will be growing over the next year, is important. It's why we launched the Stop, Think, Connect Campaign last October as part of National Cybersecurity Awareness Month. And it's why I'm asking all of you, if you have not signed up to help us on engaging the public and public awareness growth, to sign up with us now, and to consider becoming a friend of the cyber awareness campaign. When you are signed up as a friend, you receive regular updates, you take part in some of our challenge contests, and we can support and hold forums at your own institutions. So please, please consider becoming part of the public awareness efforts, and a friend of our own campaigns. As I said before, I mentioned, we're working very closely along and across the federal family, particularly having worked out really the thorny issues involving how the NSA is to be used in a civilian context for protection and prevention, as well as in a military context; very different types of worlds, and we want to make sure that we do it the right way, and we do it the right away from the outset. So let me just close with this thought. A secure and resilient cyber environment depends on everybody in this room. It depends on people who are not in this room. But if you are here, I'm assuming that you're already part of trying to address some of the issues that are raised. How do you keep an open Internet but also a secure one? And how do you work with us, and how do we work with you to get that done? Those are the kinds of challenges our country has confronted before, and by putting our best minds together, we have always met those kinds of challenges. This one may be bigger, more complex, and require more of our effort than anything we've ever dealt with. And we're going to have to make sure that we deal with it in the right way, because we are laying the foundation for the future. Thank you all very much.

TITLE: A New Challenge for Our Age: Securing America Against the Threat of Cyber Attack

TEXT: Good morning, I’m Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano. And I’d like to thank you for tuning in to this special web address today. Since we’ve been communicating about the importance of protecting the networks we rely on throughout Cybersecurity Awareness Month, I thought it would be fitting to use those networks to reach out to as many people as possible … to speak directly to you. And you can speak with me as well. If you’re watching live this morning, you can submit a question through the link on this page, and I will address as many as I can at the conclusion. Let me set the scene. A few months back, President Obama addressed in historic terms the issue of safeguarding our nation’s digital networks. He described these networks, and the hardware that supports them, as “strategic national assets” and “keys to our prosperity in the 21st century.” The growing number of attacks on these networks has become, in the President’s words, “one of the most serious economic and national security threats our nation faces.” Until now, we’ve not often talked about “cybersecurity” in such serious terms. But we must. President Obama understands well the challenge and the urgency. In his video remarks on cybersecurity last week, the President challenged the nation to “seize the promise” and also “confront the perils” that technology brings. As the agency charged with the broad mission of protecting the nation’s cyber infrastructure, systems and networks, the Department of Homeland Security is playing a key role in meeting the President’s challenge. And so this morning I want to speak clearly and candidly about what cybersecurity really means for our nation. And I want to reach out to all of you: from experts, to businesspeople, to ordinary Americans, and especially those of you who may be daunted by all things “cyber.” Cybersecurity is not some abstract concept. This isn’t a discussion about computers, or about data bits and bytes. It’s about the networks we use to communicate, to shop, to do our banking, and run our businesses. So I’ll speak in plain terms about what these technologies mean for Americans. Like it or not, we’re all in this together. And wherever you are on that spectrum – from skilled professional to computer novice – we all depend on secure cyber networks. So: I’m going to be honest with you about the risks and threats that are out there; I’m going to tell you what our Department is doing to reduce those risks; and I’m going to ask for your help. Our nation, like the rest of the globalized world, has become “digitally dependent.” And this “networked world” we now live in has evolved at a lightening pace. Consider that from the time the telephone was invented in 1876 it took another 50 years for the first transatlantic phone call to be placed, and almost 80 years before all Americans could even dial long distance. By comparison, the first commercial web browser came out just over 15 years ago, and today the vast majority of Americans are online, as are more than a billion-and-a-half people around the world. Today’s high school freshmen have never lived in a world without the Internet. Google was established when they were two years old, so they have always been able to access information on demand. Today: We rely on the Internet for banking, buying things, and staying in touch. Businesses rely on their cyber networks in myriad ways: interacting with clients, processing transactions, reaching new markets. Our transportation, financial, energy, and communications systems – as well as our government and military – rely heavily on computer networks to function. It’s how your airplane stays on course, how you get your electricity, your Social Security check, and your veterans benefits. But the very openness of the Internet, one of its great strengths, is also its greatest vulnerability. The 9/11 hijackers used travel sites to plan their attacks. Computers you can buy for under $1,000 can produce the next Great American Novel in the hands of a talented writer, or build the next great business. But they can also allow bad people to steal that novel, or the trade secrets your company has worked so hard to develop, or, in the case of the government, to steal classified information – crimes that can put futures and lives at risk. So, as President Obama said in May, “cyberspace is real. And so are the risks that come with it.” We see thousands of attempts a day to hack into our nation’s government, military, and private sector networks. We’ve had computer viruses and worms infect millions of computers around the world, destroying important information, and disrupting commerce. And American businesses have lost billions of dollars – and millions of Americans have had their personal information stolen or compromised – by cyber criminals, organized crime, and foreign intelligence agencies. We tend to call these “cyber-crimes” or “cyber-attacks.” But, in fact, they are attacks on people like you and me, and on the institutions we build. Think of it this way: If a predator is seeking to contact your children through an online social network, that’s not a cyber crime to you. It’s a threat to the safety and security of your loved ones and your family. If your account numbers are stolen by an online spoof site pretending to be your real bank, that’s no longer a computer issue. It’s your ability to pay your mortgage next week and buy groceries. These aren’t hypotheticals either. Two weeks ago, the FBI charged nearly 100 people here and abroad in one of the largest cyber fraud cases ever seen. In attacks like this, the victims are people like you and me who have been tricked into providing real information to fake sites – and who then see their savings drained, and their credit ruined, by thieves using nothing more than computers. The bad guys never even have to leave their chairs. President Obama has said that the status quo is not sufficient. Mitigating these risks at all levels is an urgent national security priority and a significant technological challenge. Ok, so who’s in charge here? It’s a fair question because no one individual or organization runs the internet … or runs our cyber networks. So no one person or organization is in charge. The networks we rely on everyday provide us a shared benefit. The enormous opportunity that this technology provides our society can be shared by all as well. But the risks and dangers of that technology are also shared, and so the security of our networks, our digital infrastructure, our cyberspace must also be a shared responsibility. Let me say that again. Just as with our nation’s preparedness for natural disasters or terrorist attacks, our nation’s cybersecurity is a shared responsibility. And it’s an opportunity for you, as an individual, to personally contribute to our national security. Securing your home computer helps you and your family. And it also helps your nation in some very important ways. It helps by reducing the risk to our financial system from theft; and to our nation from having your computer infected and then used as a tool to attack other computers. As individuals, the steps you need to take are clear, and they will make a big difference: Install and activate firewalls for your computer and internet connection. Make sure your anti-virus and anti-spyware software is installed and up-to-date. Check your computer settings to make sure your operating system and applications are automatically patched. Practice good online habits by not visiting suspect sites, downloading suspicious documents or attachments, or opening email from people you don’t know. Back up your files regularly and use strong and secure  passwords; and Begin educating your children early about staying safe online. Of course, government has a responsibility to lead. And we’re doing just that. Since taking office, President Obama has made protection of our digital networks and infrastructure a top priority, and across the federal family of agencies, we are responding aggressively to the threat. Under the President’s plan, the Department of Homeland Security is leading federal efforts to secure federal executive branch civilian government networks – the .Gov world. But DHS also performs two other critical functions. We are partnering with the private sector to help secure the networks that power our economy – the .Com world. And we’re helping educate the American people about the practical measures that they can take to improve their own safety online, and our nation’s collective cyber defenses. Let me share a few of the steps our Department is taking. We have consolidated our cyber efforts under the leadership of a highly regarded cybersecurity expert – Phil Reitinger – to improve coordination between government, industry, and international partners. This includes: the National Cyber Security Division, including the US Computer Emergency Readiness Team, also known as US-CERT; and the National Cyber Security Center. We’re working closely across the federal family to protect the federal civilian networks and systems. First, we’re reducing and consolidating the number of external connections federal agencies have to the Internet through the Trusted Internet Connections initiative. Then, we’re implementing DHS’s intrusion detection capability, known as EINSTEIN, to those Trusted Internet Connections. And through US-CERT and other programs, we’re working more closely than ever with the private sector to detect and understand threats, share knowledge, and learn from the best that the private sector has to offer. Just this year, DHS helped mitigate two potentially major cyber threats – the release of the Conficker computer worm, and the Denial of Service attacks we saw over the July 4th weekend. In both cases DHS worked closely with the private sector to analyze the attacks, develop strategies to mitigate them, and collaborate on solutions that were fast, widely shared, and compatible at all levels. I believe that this kind of partnership with the private sector can provide a model for deeper engagement … engagement to protect our nation’s critical infrastructure. That infrastructure is heavily reliant on networks, and the vast majority of it – some estimate around 85 percent – is in private hands. To be most effective, we in government must work closely with the private sector, and include it in our work as a full partner from the very start. And so DHS is working closely with businesses and trade groups across our economy to better understand risk and vulnerabilities, to collaborate on detecting and responding to intrusions, and to build the relationships that will let us work together to respond to attacks as one nation, and at “Internet speed.” Let me close by saying that even with the leadership of the U.S. government, and the engagement of the private sector, and help of ordinary Americans, we still need to do more. As aggressive as we are being, as fast as we’re moving, our cyber adversaries will continue to succeed … unless our nation rises to this challenge in new ways. We can’t treat this as a “government issue” or “corporate” issue. The protection of our digital networks is no longer a just a cyber or an IT issue. For people affected, it’s a human issue and an economic issue. And for the nation, it’s about the future of our prosperity. I truly believe that when we read our history books in future years, we will see that what we faced was a technical and scientific challenge on par with some of the great challenges of the last century, like getting to the Moon, or sequencing the human genome. I also believe there is no better catalyst for rising to this new challenge than our nation’s culture of innovation, and our world-leading higher education system. As a good indication of how seriously I take this challenge, I’ve made a very significant down payment on our nation’s cybersecurity future. Earlier this month, we announced that DHS has been given expedited hiring authority to bring on up to 1,000 additional skilled cyber professionals over the next three years. And here is our message to those professionals and future-professionals: Not only does DHS want you, your nation needs you. We need our best and brightest, our finest computer scientists and engineers, mathematicians, and innovative thinkers. I want you to look to DHS. We’re a new Department, but we’re an exciting and dynamic one, with a strong and clear mission. At DHS, you’ll work hard and you’ll be pushed because the stakes are high. And you will have an immediate opportunity to serve and to make a difference. Some of you will work to protect the nation in our National Protection and Programs Directorate, or NPPD. Others will join the Secret Service or Immigrations and Customs Enforcement to help stop international financial criminals or sexual predators. All of you will have a chance to make a difference and to serve your nation. You’ll find a link on DHS.gov/Cyber where you can see the exciting positions that are already posted. I want to thank you again for tuning in today. And I hope you’ll share this message with others by sending them to DHS.Gov to watch the video of these remarks. Together, we can build a more ready and resilient nation that is stronger and smarter than the determined adversaries we all face. Thank you. And I look forward to answering some of the questions you’ve sent in.

TITLE: Remarks by Secretary Napolitano at the Global Cyber Security Conference

TEXT: I want to thank the Secret Service, S&T [DHS Science and Technology Directorate]—of our office for hosting this meeting on cybersecurity—an area that has commanded special attention from me in my office since I began my tenure as Secretary. Indeed, even before—at the state level as we repeatedly saw our state systems hacked into—it is not a threat of the future. It is an actuality. Indeed, it was just about a year ago today that criminal charges came from a Secret Service investigation into the theft and sale of 40 million credit card numbers by an international group of cyber criminals. And that case, I believe, was just the tip of the iceberg in terms of the damage that cyber crime, cybersecurity can entail. We have to look at the landscape now; but, more important, we have to—I think—acknowledge amongst ourselves that in terms of cybersecurity we've been living in a cyber 1.0 world and we need to be cyber 3.0 and beyond. Because the minute we start talking about a particular methodology of cyber the cyber bad guys are already moving ahead. This is a very, very rapidly evolving environment in which real crime and real damage can occur. So let me, if I might, tell you where the administration is, what we've done, and then solicit some questions. But, as you know, the president ordered a 60-day cyber review and that was designed to say, “Hey—look. We have cyber stuff kind of all through different parts of this big behemoth called the federal government. How do we get it coordinated? How do we get it focused? Who is going to do what?” And the review concluded that the Department of Defense [DOD] would obviously be in charge of the protection of the dot mil side of the federal government. And then the Department of Homeland Security [DHS] would be in charge of the dot-gov, the civilian side of the government; i.e., everything else and, also, the intersection with the non-government private side's dot-org, dot-com. When I came into the department I think it’s fair to say we were not organized sufficiently where cybersecurity is concerned; that it was just as these efforts were kind of spread throughout the federal government—they were kind of spread throughout the Department of Homeland Security. So I recruited Phil Reitinger to come back into the government. He had been at DOJ [Department Of Justice]. He had gone over to Microsoft and I recruited him back to be the Deputy Under Secretary for Cyber at the Department of Homeland Security—and who put all of our cyber efforts under his directorate so that everything having to do with cyber would be there, including the National Cybersecurity Center [NCSC]. So, if the question is who at the Department of Homeland Security—who do you call—it’s either going to be Phil or someone who works for him. If it's a crime—the Secret Service as well—who is our lead agency on cyber? I asked the question the other day. I said, “Why is the Secret Service involved in cyber? How did that happen?” And I think the answer is significant. The reason the Secret Service is in there evolves from their historical jurisdiction, protecting the security of our currency and our banking institutions—and, of course, financial institutions are one of the prime targets of cyber threats. So, from that historical antecedent—which goes back to the 18th century—we now have the Secret Service being the lead agency on cyber crime throughout the federal government and in the Department of Homeland Security. Under Phil Reitinger are also the U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Teams known as US-CERT. They work extensively with the private sector to protect government networks from an increasing number of attacks. I already mentioned the National Cyber Security Center and others we have now recruited and are recruiting out of the private sector in the computer world—the cyber world—to come in and provide their expertise and lend their expertise to us. I have something called the Homeland Security Advisory Council [HSAC]. It meets with me regularly. It meets—more importantly—with our upper staff regularly. We actually put a well-regarded former hacker and asked him to come over from the dark side for a little bit and help us there, so that we are reaching out into different worlds to move from that cyber 1.0 environment into cyber 3.0 and beyond. We are also part of the International Watch and Warning Network [IWWN], which includes 15 countries and of course that is very, very important. And let me just pause a moment there. The cyber involvement knows no national boundaries. It knows no nation or state organization. It, in short, is not organized the way we are organized. We are organized in nice categories, and even in an international environment we are organized in these kind of international organizations—none of which fits cyber and cybersecurity. And that’s exactly what I mean when I say we need to move creatively from the 1.0 to the 3.0 world. In the Secret Service—and there are many Secret Service I know in the audience today—they have done some incredible work in the cyber environment. The Electronic Crimes Task Force [ECTF]—of which there are 28, including one that just opened in Rome—are illustrative of the kinds of efforts that we need to not only have, but also enlarge. Another innovative thing that the Secret Service is a part of is the National Computer Forensic Institute [NCFI] which is a pilot between the Secret Service and the state of Alabama to provide free of charge training to state and local partners to build cybersecurity readiness in all sectors. So we’ve got the international aspect of this and the state and local aspect of this. And, I can say—as the former governor and as an attorney general who started one of the first cyber crime units in the country—how very, very important that is. I myself in my travels internationally have now signed a number of agreements with countries on cyber. But I think it is important to recognize that there is no international structure where cyber and cyber crime is concerned. That is part of where we need to go. So as we look at moving forward from our historical antecedents to where we are now—the division of responsibilities in the federal government, the things the Secret Service already has done, what are some of the issues that we need to confront? First of all, we need to confront how we really engage our partners. More than just having a conference, what are our actual plans for working together? How are we going to share intelligence from the government to the private sector and back in real time, so that it's useful? How will we work together on a day-to-day basis? How are we going to grow, recruit and retain experts or cyber cops and experts in cybersecurity? In other words, where are the personnel going to come from who are going to help us in this effort—and that's particularly important, because in the cyber world, there is such an easy flow within the private sector. How do we grow our own cyber experts who will work within a government framework and how do we make sure we will recruit and retain top talent? Our goal at the Department of Homeland Security, quite frankly—between Phil’s efforts and the Secret Service—is to be the repository for cybersecurity and to really recruit the best minds in the country. How do we do that? How do we build that capacity? How do we build capacity to keep ahead of the bad guys? How do we get creative and think not just of what they've done, but what they're going to do next and next and next? And then how do we share those ideas so that we are not chronically playing catch-up where the cyber field is concerned. How do we stay aware and share information about developing threats in the cyber world? How can we continually be more innovative than our enemies would have us be? For those of you who are in academia—how can we fully involve the research and development efforts that you are undertaking in the cybersecurity efforts that we are making? For example, right now on the military side of things we have a very impressive military R&D [research and development] capacity, but we have much fewer R&D. We don’t have that kind of R&D capacity for things like cybersecurity on the civilian side. That's why we have to engage with private sector partners. That’s why academia could be very, very important. And how do we engage the American people and build understanding about the cyber threat? The critical issue here is not just for the big players; the entire private sector, but every business in the United States, large or small; every home that has a computer in it and that is, as you know, an increasing number of our homes. They are now part and parcel; not just who could be attacked, but how we protect ourselves before an attack occurs. So our challenge in moving from 1.0 to 3.0 is how to take the capacity, the wisdom, the intelligence of everyone in this room and outside and harness it in a way that gives us really an ideal protection network across the United States. Now, one activity ongoing now that I want to share with you that you can't help provide input into is something called the "Quadrennial Homeland Security Review," the QHSR. But the QHSR is modeled after what they do at the Department of Defense. This will be the first one on the civilian side at the Department of Homeland Security and what it is designed to do is to really provide the strategic—not the tactical—but the strategic goals for the Department of Homeland Security over the next four years. And we are very aggressively seeking input into that, because as the newest federal department this could be very, very useful and immediately put to work in terms of how we guide our efforts. How do you do that and provide input? Well, there's a website, of course. It's called Homeland Security dialogue dot-org; Homeland Security dialogue dot-org—all one word—homelandsecuritydialogue.org. And the input there is being then placed into that QHSR process and also—to the extent something useful is provided on the cybersecurity area from a strategy standpoint into our 2011 and 2012 budget and budget request—so these are the kinds of challenges we have. How do we employ the people here? In the capacities that you have, how do we knit ourselves together more quickly? How do we share intel on a real time basis and cross our different silos, as it were, to make sure that the protection of the cyber environment—which is not a static target, but a moving one—but that the protection of that environment is and remains a top priority in which we achieve success; so thank you all for what you have been doing. More importantly, I hope I have challenged you to think ahead now about what we need to do in the cyber future. Thank you very much.
